The Q9h doesn't aggressively cancel background noise, but voices came through just fine on my tests. Signal strength was good as well.

Video performance was a bit spottier. Videos on the Q9h played in full screen, but stuttered occasionally, and I got relatively low frame rates on my CorePlayer video benchmark tests. Video and music can be stored in the Q9h's roomy MB of onboard memory or on a microSD card tucked into a convenient slot on the side.
