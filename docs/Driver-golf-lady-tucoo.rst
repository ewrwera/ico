Another great thing about the F9 is the adjustability and the dual roll technology. The adjustable loft ensures you get a good flight trajectory every time which is crucial for slower swing speeds.

The 12 degree loft and low center of gravity will also help to get a good launch angle on every drive along with the ball speed for distance.

Players, who have the tendency to slice the ball towards the right, could benefit with a closed face. Meanwhile, decreasing the loft will open the face of the driver pointing to the right of the target line for a right-hand player.
