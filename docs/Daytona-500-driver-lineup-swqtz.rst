Kyle Larson 'a better person' as wins, sponsors return after suspension. The 36 Charter teams are guaranteed a spot in the Daytona field, and eight Open, non-Charter teams competed for the final four spots via a mix of Duel results and single-car qualifying speeds from earlier in the week.
After the Bluegreen Vacations Duel races, here is the Daytona starting lineup. Starting Driver Team 1. Alex Bowman No.
William Byron No. Aric Almirola No. Austin Dillon No. Christopher Bell No. Bubba Wallace No. Ryan Newman No. Anyone who backs these drivers could hit it big. So who wins the Daytona ?
