Right-click on the Start button and select the Device Manager In the Device Manager section, you will get several lists of devices identified by your system. You can get non specified devices list under the other devices section.
Click the arrow to expand the listed categories of the devices to check the hardware ID. Then right-click on your required device and select the properties section. In the properties section, enter the details tab. Now you will get Hardware IDs in the property drop-down list Now you will get all the list of hardware IDs related to your chosen hardware device.
Consider the top one for the latest and most suitable for your device. I have tried to keep the site and its code as transparent as possible to the users and I vow to keep the source open. List All Devices. Once you have opened the Device Manager, you need to select the device you need drivers for.
It will usually have a yellow triangle with an exclamation point in it, or be called "Unknown Device". Like this:. A definition that included bus-specific fields would look like using the eepro driver again :. Some may find the syntax of embedded struct initialization awkward or even a bit ugly.
The driver registers the structure on startup. For drivers that have no bus-specific fields i. It is important that drivers register their driver structure as early as possible. These fields are assumed to be valid at all times and may be used by the device model core or the bus driver. By defining wrapper functions, the transition to the new model can be made easier.
Drivers can ignore the generic structure altogether and let the bus wrapper fill in the fields. For the callbacks, the bus can define generic callbacks that forward the call to the bus-specific callbacks of the drivers.
This solution is intended to be only temporary. In order to get class information in the driver, the drivers must be modified anyway. Since converting drivers to the new model should reduce some infrastructural complexity and code size, it is recommended that they are converted as class information is added.
Once the object has been registered, it may access the common fields of the object, like the lock and the list of devices:.
