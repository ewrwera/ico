I have purchased multiple of it and have been satisfied with the purchase so far. I have placed one of these in every vehicle, a we ll as all of my Range bags and Drone kits. It has all the features and functions necessary to address the small issues I see daily with my current lifestyle. I was not looking for a survivalist product, just something convenient to add to my daily tools.
Light weight, and as compact as it needs to be. Too big for use on a key chain, so I dont recommend that, but it is small enough for the glove box, or as an emergency tool kit for the outdoors type. Verified purchase: Yes Condition: New. Skip to main content. About this product. About this product Product Identifiers Brand. Launce and Tom have designed this multi-tool to be as compact and lightweight as possible. Handle length is only 3.
It is the perfect small screwdriver. Not only can it be rotated like a conventional screwdriver, but the bit driver can be removed and placed in a hex relief in the handle, where it becomes an angle driver when more torque is needed. The four hex bits each have a spring-loaded ball to retain them in the handle securely, and also have a thin groove so that they can be easily pressed out of the handle and removed with a fingernail.
On the opposite end of the handle is a powerful LED flashlight with a press-on, press-off switch button. The underside of the handle is a mirror-polished stainless steel frame with wrench reliefs for hex bits, 10 mm nuts and standard oxygen bottle valves. It also has a stainless steel bottle and jar opener attached.
