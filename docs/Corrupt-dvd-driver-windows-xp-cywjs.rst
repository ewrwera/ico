The device may be listed under "Other Devices" or other places in Device Manager. Last edited: Jun 16,  Reactions: Balusri , wathan and Rytech. Dandy Dave. Your article is very good except for one thing. I found 4 files under the driver tab in properties of the device. None were of the 3 you indicated, I never found a way to delete them there much less how to paste the correct files to the driver; therefore, I was unable to correct the problem I have been dealing with for about 6 hours and now I'm more frustrated than ever.
Thanks Sir, 1 week searchin how to fix my Problem and Finally its Done I follow all the steps and adding only 1 step by using MicrosoftFixit. Thank you, my computer have been solved.
Sean McDougall. If the above doesn't work, then try opening computer management just type it into your search box and look under storage. You may well see your disk listed there but without a drive letter. Right click on the disk and choose assign drive letter. Give it a name D: or Z: - whatever and you should then see it in Explorer again. Th three files exist would that mean that the usb mass storage driver is not corrupt? I am not able to see the driver when I dbl click computer.
I am not a computer expert and please give me answers in a step by step and I can do it Code 39 then I try to reload them and it says they are loaded properly, but I get the same errors. Help is appreciated. This thread is locked. You can follow the question or vote as helpful, but you cannot reply to this thread. I have the same question 2. Report abuse. Details required :. In the bios setup sceen. You should now see the advance bios features screena and the boot priority of Devices.
Press Enter. The computer will restart. Okay, so you have inserted the Live CD and rebooted your computer. The computer should now boot from the Live CD. If it does not, then repeat the procedure mentioned in steps 1 and 2 and make sure that the First boot device is "CDROM". If the computer boots from the DVD, you should see the Language selection screen. My preferred language is english, so highlight the option and press Enter. In the next screen, Select "Try ubuntu without making any change to your computer" and press enter.
The selection if already not selected will have to be done by direction keys on keyboard Ubuntu will then go about booting from the DVD. Once ubuntu has booted, you will see the ubuntu desktop. You should see "places" on the top most bar. In the drop down menu, select "My computer". My computer will now open. On the left hand side you should see the available drivers.
