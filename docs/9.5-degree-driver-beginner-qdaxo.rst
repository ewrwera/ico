This is a great driver for a beginner trying to improve their overall game, and it really is designed with new players and those who have a high handicap in mind.
This driver increases the moment of inertia with its position of the center of gravity, placed as far back and as low as possible. The carbon composite head makes this a very light driver. This also forces the center of gravity even lower, something that Callaway is already known for doing. The head is caged in titanium for additional enhancement. The carbon fiber on the sole and crown also adds to the extra light nature of this driver. Used is a gram weight that can be moved slightly on the back of the head.
This means the center of gravity goes as far back and as low as possible. It looks more like a triangle than the more traditional options. Whether or not you like the design will be a matter of personal preference.
However, this head can give you a quite consistent distance given its breakneck head speed. There is also airflow that is smoother than with a traditionally shaped head and a faster ball speed. The driver was that it had some qualities intended to improve the golf game of true beginners.
It is very responsive, and its very lightweight nature makes it easy to maneuver and handle. It is a bit dated when it comes to technology and comes up short when it comes to forgiveness. It is far less forgiving than other drivers we reviewed, which can be challenging for new golfers. It can also help to improve your game quicker. In fact, this Cleveland driver is likely to give you some serious improvements to your game. However, it does not have some of the high-tech options you will find with other drivers on this list.

Given that this driver is made for beginners, it also allows for really consistent results with a good amount of forgiveness. This driver is also pretty user-friendly for the extreme beginner. Some beginners might even find that the length is a bit too long to maneuver. Length, of course, is subjective but can be a consideration with this driver. If you think that you need a boost in elevation to increase your overall distance, this driver might be a great fit for your game. Overall, this is a great driver for those who are beginners and have a mid- to- high handicap.
It might not last you all that long, given that as your game improves, you will likely outgrow this driver. Right out of the box, the Cobra Speedback is a total surprise.
It looks great and has a massive clubhead that allows even the most novice golfers to feel confident that they will hit a good shot. We love that the club head features an elliptical pattern and a large, sweet spot, both of which are vital for beginners to have confidence in their driving game.
The elliptical pattern ensures that the ball will have solid contact, regardless of where it strikes the clubhead, which is an excellent feature for beginners. The amount of customization and options you have with the Cobra Speedback are great for a beginner.
You will also have several options when it comes to the shaft material and stiffness; Cobra offers 4 different stiffness options and has a great chart that will help you identify which is best for you. One of the many reasons that Cobra has made a name for itself throughout the golf community is the several options they offer to drivers and the quality that comes with them.
The F-Max Superlite is no exception as it provides senior golfers with an incredible driver at a great price point. The club head is one of the most aerodynamic options on the market.

The clubface is made from titanium and which is one of our favorite materials for club heads because it is ultra-strong and durable.
Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the Cobra F-Max Superlite and find it is a great option for senior golfers looking to become more confident with their driver.
Callaway has long been associated with excellence in golf and the Mavrik driver is exactly why. It is one of the lightest drivers we tested and with the number of custom options you can choose from, you truly cannot go wrong with this driver.
You can choose between 5 different shaft options and also be able to adjust your loft setting easily on the fly. The thing that impressed us the most with the Mavrik driver was the increase in distance that we saw with our own golf games and everyone we had test this club.
It was amazing to see that nearly every person who used the club was able to add upwards of 20 extra yards onto the end of their drives. While this is not the cheapest on the market for beginners, we are comfortable telling you that this will be one of the best investments you make in your golf game.
It is a reliable, durable driver that golfers of all skill levels, especially beginners, will appreciate. Things we like about this driver include how lightweight it is, making it particularly easy to maneuver and handle.
Besides, the large sweet spot makes using this driver even easier. You can reduce your slice with this driver, given its offset technology. The design and look of this driver are both unique. The finish is a sleek matte black color, but it has colorful stripes to make it stand out. The club itself offers an understated elegance while also not looking like every other driver. This driver should be easy to use for most golfers, even very new beginners.
It weighs just grams. This is a great driver for getting started before you move up to more elite clubs. The sweet spot on this driver is huge, which means that you should experience maximum forgiveness every time, regardless of where you make an impact.

Quick Summary: The ideal loft for beginners would be between degrees due to slower swings. The best loft on your driver for beginners is dependent on the average club head speed generated but typically in this range I would recommend a beginner golfer purchasing a driver that is between degrees in loft to get optimal ball distance.
This loft would be recommended and allow beginners to find the best driver for a beginner. An ideal driver that would accommodate this loft would be the Taylormade M2 or the Callaway Mavrik Max. As your speed improves the loft of the driver should decrease in accordance to this. This will help to make sure that you maximize ball distance by using as much loft as you need.

Therefore, the loft required for maximum distance will increase. Depending on the performance level of the senior golfer in question the best loft for senior golfers should be somewhere between  The best choice of here would be one of our choices of the best drivers for seniors such as the Taylormade RBZ Driver.
An average driver loft would be  Unless you have exceptionally fast club head speed for an amateur, we would advise against using less loft such as a 9. When comparing a 9. If you are beginner then using a  However, if you have a higher club head speed a 9. In years past, you would have to purchase an entirely new driver to be able to change the loft.
Today you can adjust the loft within a matter of seconds. We love the adjustable loft options for golfers that are going through swing changes and working on making improvements to their game. The faster you swing, the stiffer the golf shaft that you are going to need. Players that struggle to get distance most likely have a slower swing, and they need a more flexible golf shaft. You can have your swing speed tested quite easily to determine the flex of the shaft that you need for your game.
Most golfers find that the  You will find that even with average swing speeds, the  Choosing a club that is adjustable may give you the chance to get more fine tuned with either 10 or 11 degrees of loft on the days that you need it. The SIM 2 Max comes with a new forged ring construction that helps it to be lightweight and even more powerful than before.
The head is a bit more aerodynamic than previous golf drivers on the market and it has the same Speed pocket technology that we have enjoyed from TaylorMade.
Hopefully, you now have a better idea as to which of these driver lofts is going to be better for your game. With the 12 degrees of loft, the ball can sometimes end up a little too high, and it will cost a player distance.
When you choose a driver with the adjustability, you open up a wide range of possibilities for your golf game. Regardless of your strengths and weaknesses, you can get the performance you need for your game. Hi, I am Matthew, a mid handicap golfer who likes to play as much as possible.
