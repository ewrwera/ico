Only Vista drivers are available for that model. You could try your luck and install in compatibility mode. How satisfied are you with this reply? Thanks for your feedback, it helps us improve the site. In reply to Andre Da Costa's post on November 27,  Thankyou for your quick response - my last PC was on Windows 10 and i downloaded the driver from Oki at the time - so seems a little odd that it is not available now?
Rohn MVP. That appears to be an old printer no longer supported by Oki. Searching the web I found a couple of links with drivers for Windows versions around XP. Since it is no longer supported all I can suggest is doing your own search. In reply to AmandaRBaker's post on November 27,  Did you try checking Windows Update to see if you can download it from there?
