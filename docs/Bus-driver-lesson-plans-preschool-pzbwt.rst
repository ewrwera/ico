One of my favorite ways to start the new year with my preschool class year olds is to celebrate the iconic school bus! But be careful, it will be stuck in your head for the rest of your life.
School Bus Art and Crafts Here are a few of the school bus art projects and crafts we did. You can find details about the first project HERE. The second project I simply drew a rough sketch of a school bus and had the kids paint it yellow at the easel.
The third project I printed out a picture of a school bus and then let the kids use the yellow Dot Marker to jazz it up. I hope you have found something useful here today! Like It? Did you enjoy this post? Hang pictures on the wall of different modes of transportation including walking, horses, hot air balloons, trucks, etc. Provide different types of small manipulatives that can be used to make vehicles or cities! Provide the children with Transportation Theme shapes that are hole punched around the edges and yarn tie a knot on one end of the yarn.
This is great practice for using their small muscles and helps build eye-hand coordination. These cards can be purchases or you can make them yourself. Make a shape the transportation theme shape on a piece of thin cardboard the back of a pad of paper or notebook covers work well or stock paper.
Laminate the cards. For lacing string, shoe laces work great! Or, you can make your own by using yarn and taping one end to make it easier for the yarn to go through the hole. In advance, prepare the manila folder. Open the folder and draw lines across the folder across the shorter side all the way down the folder, about 1 inch apart. Also prepare a dice. This is a 2 person game. The purpose is to work on small hand muscles, eye-hand coordination while practicing taking turns.
To Play: Each of the 2 children should choose a Transportation Theme manipulative car, boat, etc. One child rolls the dice and moves his car that many rows toward the other child. The second child then rolls the dice and moves her item that many rows toward the other child. During play, remind them whose. Extension: Use a dice with colors instead and tape colored strips of paper on the rows.
Extension: Make a homemade spinner with numbers instead of using dice. Make cards of transportation theme items such as cars, trucks, buses, children walking, horses, etc.
For patterning, you will need multiple of each type 10 of each. Laminate them for durability. Encourage the children to make patterns with them car, car, truck; car, truck, bus, car, truck, bus. Extension: Take 2 of each type out of the set you made. Play a matching game with them with the children. Variation: Rather than make cards for patterning, use transportation theme plastic sorters to make the above patterns. In advance, turn identical small boxes into matching garages for example, clean empty juice boxes or milk cartons with brown paper.
Tape numbers or number words on each garage. Tape corresponding numbers on toy cars. Provide a large assortment of transportation theme items and bowls. Allow children to sort by the different attributes that they see.
You can upgrade this by putting names to each bowl. Some ideas are to sort by:. Talk with the children about traffic lights red means stop, green means go, yellow means to go really slow.. Tell the children they will be dancing to the music but need to watch you you are the traffic light!
When you put up the Green paper, they should dance, when you put up the Red paper, they should Stop Freeze. Variation: Have songs on a CD that vary in tempo: some slow and some fast. Tell the children to dance to the beat- some will be fast and some will be slow. When the music stops, they should Stop freeze! Play the music. If it is fast, hold up a green paper, hold up yellow if it is slow.
Stop the music now and then for them to freeze and hold up the Red paper. When playing the CD, only play each song for about 15 seconds and then change it!
Play as interest continues. We have also added dancing scarves or pieces of fabric for them to sway and dance with during this. Children love to push these items on or through mud or shaving cream in your Sand and Water table! Comment on the tracks they make. Ask where their vehicle is going and what it is doing! Materials Needed: Water; transportation vehicles Find vehicles that sink as well as vehicles that float.
Give each child a vehicle. Take turns asking each child if they think their vehicle will sink or float? Invite them to put their vehicle in the water table to find out. Once all the children have had a turn, allow them to just play at the water table with the vehicles. Extension: Make a rebus chart picture chart of the vehicles you will be using.
Using a large piece of paper, make 3 columns. Draw a picture in this first column of each mode of transportation I'm not a great artist so I either take pictures of each item, print the picture and glue it in the column or print out clip art! Ask the children if they think the first item pictured will sink or float. Count aloud how many children think it will sink and list that number next to the picture under the SINK column.
Then ask how many children think it will float and list that number next to the item under the FLOAT column. Drop the item in the table or have a child do it.
Ask if it sank or floated and discuss their guesses! A way to avoid this is to ask all the children who think it will sink to stand on "this side" of the water table if they think it will float to stand on the other side. Then count the children and list on the chart. You may want to laminate this chart before using and use dry erase markers on it. Then you can use it each time you have a transportation theme.
Fill a plastic bottle plastic bottle we use smaller bottles such as 1 liter bottles. The 2 liter bottles are difficult for the children to manipulate.
Hot glue the cap on. Use bottles with a large mouth opening like a juice bottle. Add sand. Add small transportation theme items. Hot glue cover on and let the children search for the items by moving it around!
Materials needed: Small plastic bottle, 1 tablespoon of sugar, water, 1 packet of yeast, one small round balloon. Children cut out modes of transportation. They glue them on a piece of paper. Ask them about their pictures and write down exactly what they say. Have them write their name on their page. Staple all of the children's pages together to make a Class Book. Extension: Glue a picture of the child on their page. Place the book in the Library area.
Children love to read books with pictures of themselves! Transportation Theme Field Trips. Also, ask if they have any old hoses, spark plugs, etc. Is there an airport near you? Small, municipal airports can be a great visit, especially if you can time it so that the children can see some airplanes or helicopters land! Visiting the farm is not just for your Farm Theme! A lot can be seen with a Transportation Theme in mind!
Of course you will visit the farm animals while you are there! However, in advance, speak with the farmer or owner of the farm to arrange having the vehicles they use at the farm including tractors, wagons, horses and their pickup truck!
