Did you mean:. Last reply by Gina Q Unsolved. Missing XP driver for Bluetooth module. Hi all! However I was not able to make the Bluetooth module work. I downloaded the relevant device driver R All is working fine, the headphones now appear permanently in 'Devices and Printers' and the cats are playing with the Belkin adapter on the floor! Thanks for you input - in following your suggestions I've learned a lot about my computer and bluetooth and then suddenly "the problem fixed itself" Windows took quite a while to locate and download drivers - but all is well!
Many thanks! Now to try to find out what is bugging my new Android tablet - which I bought for educational purposes so I can't complain if I now have to learn about how it works!

That was a great help - many thanks. It solves the computer's problem every time! I can have one or the other working without a 'need to troubleshoot' warning.
I've tried several times with the same result every time - fix the computer driver for bluetooth module and the adapter driver has a problem as soon as I plug it in..
Fix the adapter driver problem and the computer's module develops a driver problem. I have noted that bluetooth actually works just fine when a driver problem with the Dell Module exists and will not work when a driver problem with the Belkin adapter exists.
So my next question is - what is the purpose of the Module and can will bluetooth work if it is deleted from my computer? It's a Belkin bluetooth adapter F8TO16ng. I've been to Broadcom and updated to their latest driver - which is what caused the problem originally. What I infer from your post is that I can use either the Belkin or the Dell Module - that I've been trying to kill one bird with two stones so far.
So - how do I get the Dell Module to operate? The only place I can find that acknowledges its existence is Device Manager. Yes - both are Broadcom, I've discovered and you confirm.
Certainly the one will not sit with the other - one or the other will show a fault with the drivers. As above and as Rajesh has suggested, I'd like to try to activate the Dell Module but do not know how. I was not aware of its existence until I plugged in the Belkin adapter and even now can only find it in Device Manager. I really appreciate the zeal in learning things. Glad to know that the issue is fixed on the computer.
