Taking advantage from our wide experience in industrial printing, Epson brings to the corporate and outsourcing markets the new WorkForce Pro printers. As the 1 selling projector manufacturer worldwide, Epson projectors have outstanding image quality and reliability at a low cost. How did you get the driver in the first place as Epson does not make either a Win or XP driver for this printer!!
I assume this is a "simple" driver from Microsoft. All it is loading is a generic Epson driver.. Epson doesn't make one for it so Windows can't have it!! Have you tried using emulation on this printer? I do not have one, but often the clever can find in the pritner documentation that it can emulate another printer for which there are drivers. If Epson does not make a dedicated driver, I have found sometimes using an IBM or Dell or whatever driver for the same underlying print engine will work.
