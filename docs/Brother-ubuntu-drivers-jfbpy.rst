Welcome to Ubuntu. By following the principles of this blog you should be able to get them going. This is not a help blog, though, just more of a personal journal. The community is usually really helpful and friendly and we all like to help each other. Brother is admittedly really bad at working with ubuntu.
Editing the libsane1. My pleasure! Glad it helped! Yeah, still alive! Same as for PaperMissiels, it was the libsane1. A real oddity though.
The scanner works fine for one user, but for another user, xsane says that it found no devices. The two users have the same list of groups. Any ideas? This is Ubuntu  Update: The oddity was the result of an old dll.
I suspect that I put it there in ! Yes, strace was my friend! Your email address will not be published. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. Wayne Out There Stuff that matters to Wayne…. My instructions below still mostly work it seems which is bad on Brother for not making this more simple — fail, fail fail I wanted to add a quick note for  Seems to work… Then, be ready to provide your printers IP address. It now seems to be libsane1.
Hope this helps! When I saw the one with IP address, I selected that one. Test print? I got paper. Restart the OS. Hope this helps.

A device driver is a piece of software designed to help your machine communicate with your mobile device or computer. Brother drivers allow your Brother printer, label maker, or sewing machine to talk directly with your device.
This allows the machinery to understand data sent from a device such as a picture you want to print or a document you want to scan , and perform the necessary actions. Think of your Brother printer driver as the translator who helps your technology to communicate more effectively. Need help with Windows 11? Learn more about Windows 11 compatibility and support.
