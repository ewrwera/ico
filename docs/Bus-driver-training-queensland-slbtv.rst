Ideal Driving School conducts one hour lessons and training is competency based. Once the student is competent with their driver licence training a practical driving test with Queensland Transport can be booked.
The student will complete the test in the same training vehicle with the Queensland Transport examiner. All Saturday lessons are required to be pre-paid. A current interstate or New Zealand driver trainer accreditation may be recognised and transferred to the equivalent Queensland accreditation for the same vehicle classes.
Applicants must apply for recognition of their existing interstate or New Zealand accreditation and pay the applicable fee. Throughout the accreditation period, accredited driver trainers must maintain satisfactory levels of competency. If the chief executive reasonably believes the trainer is not competent to give training, the trainer may be required to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the chief executive that the trainer is competent to give training.
Applications for driver trainer accreditation may be pre-lodged without course certification to allow for criminal and traffic history checks to be commenced. However course certification must be presented within 3 months from the lodgement date of the application. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the lapse of the application and a partial refund of the application fee paid. Once the chief executive has made the decision to grant the accreditation, you may be issued with an interim industry authority.
This interim industry authority will act as proof that you hold a driver trainer industry authority until your card arrives in the mail. Accreditation as a driver trainer is granted for 12 months. Application for renewal of the accreditation must be made prior to the expiry date. If your accreditation has lapsed by 3 months or more after the expiry date, you must reapply and meet new application requirements including the current training qualifications. If you are signed up for e-reminders we will email you:.
