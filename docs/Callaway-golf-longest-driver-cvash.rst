How well does it perform? Equipment Reviews. What more would you want in a driver? I truly think that Callaway makes the best drivers nowadays especially considering the prices after the clubs have been on the market for a year.
Plus, with the new release of the Rogue drivers, the Epic models have dropped pretty significantly in price. For more stability and adjustability, there is a 10g weight on the back of the crown. You can move it closer to the heel for a draw bias, or closer to the toe for a fade bias.
You can also use the adjustable hosel for 8 different configurations of loft, lie, and face angle. If you want a super long driver that is adjustable and even lower priced than the Epic, check out the Callaway Great Big Bertha driver! With these important features in mind, here are the Top Five Longest Drivers. The Golf Club Guru guarantees that you cannot go wrong with any of these picks.
You know this is special when TaylorMade, a. Golfers all over the world praise the TaylorMade M1 consistency, distance, look, and feel. It has got a very large sweet spot, with many mishit balls surprisingly sailing off far and straight down the fairway. I personally have hit balls with even the stock shaft, and can wholeheartedly agree that this driver is worth all the commotion it is causing.
The TaylorMade M1 driver is cc, but the cc head is also available to better drivers for increased workability. The stock length is 45 and a half inches, and can be purchased with a loft of 8. Left handers only have the options of 9.
What the difference? Well, same carbon composite crown and head shape, still extremely forgiving if not more forgiving , but no driver head adjustability. The flat, low spin ball flight created a nice compromise of carry distance and roll, while ball speeds are pretty consistent across a large area on the driver head in other words, even mishits will impress you with their distance. Similar to the famous M1 driver, the M2 has a light-weight carbon crown.
While the M1 offers adjustability throughout the sole, the M2 moves weight low and rearward as opposed to close to the face , to improve forgiveness. New Flash Face technology is a result of AI expertise being applied to create the new face of the drivers.
The AI modeled more than repetitions to establish the appropriate thickness throughout the face and stay in the trampoline effect limitations specified by the USGA. The outcomes of the advancements have been demonstrated and the bulk of golfers have experienced speed increases up to 10 MPH while obeying guidelines.
The escalation in ball speed demands a tougher face. The jailbreak technology from earlier drivers in the Epic range is absorbed into the Flash Face model. This makes the Epic Flash driver more accessible to a broader range of golfers though more advanced golfers proficient in influencing the ball flight will benefit for the most part.
The Flash Face comprises a sequence of thick and thin swirls that gives it the form compared to an ear. The traditional Callaway curved line is set toward the back from the guiding edge and the club lies perfectly at address.
The crown boasts thin green and gold lines on a backdrop of black carbon fiber. The ball is enclosed by two line-ups of white spots to support alignment. The five bigger rectangles across the sweet spot, beneath the laser-etched lines, generate a rejuvenating look. Generally, there is a great perceptible and sensual response via the hands that will provide for a swift adjustment to the new driver.
The initial jailbreak technology combined with the AI designed face increased ball speed across most of the face. Off-center hits are negated by the stable head with no major loss of direction and distance. High technology at a high price for high-quality golfers.
The ground-breaking blend of low Center of Gravity CoG and a sleek head is the first of its kind resulting in extra distance from a faster clubhead speed and reduces spin. A decrease in friction is accomplished through the utilization of a lightweight polymer crown and titanium sole situated relative to the path of airflow. The more triangular form in relation to comparative drivers aids to glide the club through the air.
The elevated positioning of weight on the clubhead produces a loss in distance as a result of the increased spin.
The main color on the series is yellow and black color arrangement with a secondary alternative called Avalanche color of snow which is not quite pure white. The sound and feel of the King F9 driver are similarly marginally clearer too and combined with a great range of quality shafts you get a club that feels very balanced and steady.
The Cobra F9 is a tremendously competitive driver and will be tough to defeat when assessing drivers for value for money. The balance of colors and visual appeal, although not for everyone, opens a larger market than in the past. Titleist provides some of the best drivers available and the TSi3 is sure to continue to build on this reputation.
The cc traditionally shaped head pear-shaped profile with a rounded toe combined with the new SureFit CG Track that is positioned on the rear skirt will enable you to shape your shot shape and launch attributes.
The cc head is slightly larger than the Titleist Tour offerings that measure cc. This combined with the deeper face helps to keep the spin rate lower. Unlike previous models, the sole weight is visible on the TSi3 whereas its predecessor required you to unscrew the weight to ascertain what the weight in use is. The sound produced by the TSi3 is comparable to many of its competitors that are manufactured using carbon fiber.

The Callaway Epic Flash Sub Zero was the longest driver we tested last year, and this year they've created two of the three longest drivers we've tested, in the Callaway Epic Speed and Callaway Epic Max.
Not only was the Callaway Epic Speed the longest driver we tested, it was the fourth most forgiving, making it a superb all-round driver. It's hard not to be impressed by what Callaway have done with their Epic drivers this year. Improving on the 'Jailbreak' bars that have helped boost ball speeds since their introduction in , Callaway's 'Speed Frame' further reduces crown deflection, meaning more energy is passed from club to ball. The Callaway Epic Max may have come up a little short of its sibling, the Epic Speed, when it comes to all-out distance, but the fact it offers greater forgiveness without giving up very much in yardage means it will be a fantastic driver for a huge number of golfers.
The Epic Max is the most draw capable, the highest launching and the most forgiving Callaway Epic driver available.
