This enables auto-loading of these drivers, as we saw usb-storage driver getting auto-loaded.
USB being a hardware protocol, it forms the usual horizontal layer in the kernel space. And hence for it to provide an interface to user space, it has to connect through one of the vertical layers. As character driver vertical is already discussed, it is the current preferred choice for the connection with the USB horizontal, for understanding the complete data transfer flow. Also, we do not need to get a free unreserved character major number, but can use the character major number , reserved for USB based character device files.
Usually, we would expect these functions to be invoked in the constructor and the destructor of a module, respectively. However, to achieve the hot-plug-n-play behaviour for the character device files corresponding to USB devices, these are instead invoked in the probe and the disconnect callbacks, respectively. First parameter in the above functions is the interface pointer received as the first parameter in both probe and disconnect. Moreover, as the file operations write, read, … are now provided, that is where exactly we need to do the data transfers to and from the USB device.
