If your graphics driver is up to date, you'll see a message at the top of the screen that says so. If not, you'll see a message that mentions the latest driver with a big green 'Download' button next to it. All you need to do is click that and wait for the driver to download. Once the driver download has completed, two more buttons will appear: "Express Installation" and "Custom Installation".
For most users, we recommend going with the "Express Installation". Installing your driver will take a few minutes depending on your hardware, and you may need to restart your PC when it's done. After that, congratulations, you've updated your graphics card driver.
The capability to download drivers on GeForce Experience is definitely enough for us to always have the program installed. With GeForce Experience, you can optimize your games with a mere click of the button. This means that you can get the best balance of performance and visual quality without spending an hour toiling over graphics options.
The best part is that when you open GeForce Experience, it will scan your PC for installed PC games automatically, and new games will be added to your library.
And, if you don't want to wait for the next time you open GeForce Experience, you also have the option to do a manual scan by clicking the three vertical dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting "Scan for games". He either has supernatural powers or is dreaming in a coma, but either way, this allows for some really original gameplay.
You will be able to jump out of your body, zoom out, pick another car then jump right into the body of its driver. It sounds crazy, but it looks really cool.

That said, some games have similar tools. Look for any settings that refer to image reconstruction or dynamic resolution.
This feature is what allows consoles to run so many different games so consistently. As consoles and PCs become more similar, though, more developers have started to include dynamic resolution.
Immortals Fenyx Rising and Horizon Zero Dawn, for example, both come with dynamic resolution settings. Otherwise, keep an eye out for any dynamic resolution or image reconstruction settings. The most direct way to increase your performance for free is overclocking.
Overclocking your CPU can net you some extra frames, but the process can feel tedious and complicated for newcomers. Overclocking your graphics card is much easier. Precision X1 and Afterburner both come with one-click overclocking, too. With either tool, you can run a scan to automatically apply a modest overclock to your graphics card. It might seem intimidating, but applying a slight overclock to your GPU is one of the easiest things you can do.
A few years ago, Microsoft updated Windows 10 with a Game Mode setting. Previously, you could tweak processor behavior, battery power allocation, and how the GPU is treated to see if any of these things helped your game. This system management aims to provide a stable average frame rate, which is more beneficial on lower-end systems. Once the settings app opens, make sure Game Mode is toggled on.
