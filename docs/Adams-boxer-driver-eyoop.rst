The irons deliver a face thickness of just 2. The iron is more compact than the original and features a revised Cortech multi-thickness face in a bid to produce even quicker ball speeds.
A long iron replacement with a priority on ball speed — the Mizuno Pro Fli-Hi is designed to be played with a graphite shaft. The Pro Fli-Hi comes in iron and is right-hand only.

I could hit some pretty nice skinny draws pretty consistently, but the big ballooning high a fading slice would creep in their way too often. And lately it had been showing up pretty regular. Sessions at the driving range would be unsuccessful in correcting this re-occurring problem. Which brings me to this new driver from Adams. The launch monitor would pretty much show the tendencies exhibited at the driving range and on the course. All that stopped when the salesman put that OS version of the driver into my hands.
The improvement was immediate. Not only was my skinny draw back, I could, at will straighten it out, or put a nice little fade on the ball with great accuracy…and longer by yards, well, according to the launch monitor. Something else I liked about the ball flight is that the launch angle is a little lower. To me this is a good thing, because I have to play in the wind a lot, and in the summer under dry conditions.
If I need a little more height on the drive I just tee it up a wee bit higher and play it slightly forward. I am impressed with the penetrating flight. I now have a dozen rounds under my belt with his new driver, and everyone in my regular gang is amazed. I can now hit to a spot on the fairway with either a draw, or a fade as the situation requires.
I think the headcover that comes with this driver will be copied by the way, no doubt. Just purchased adams ext insight and WOW!!! I was going to get the nike sumo sq 2 but the sales guy sold me on the adams good call.
After trying the Callaway Ft-i and being converted to it, I thought I would try the Adams Insight to see how it compared. I used to have a problem with hooking up until I bought the Callaway which helped me incredibly but I was amazed at the difference the Insight made. I am a convert to the Insight now. I went to Roger Dunn today in search of a new driver my custom one broke. DOing a lot of research, I first tried the Cobra- sounds and feels aweful, no distance.
Ping Gdid not look good at address and hits were inconsistent. Cleveland Hibore- one hit and that thing sounds like porcelain breaking. Took all the plastic covers off and man, that club felt and sounded even better! Hit the ball straight and very loooooooong. This club would hit the ball further than anything I had tried, or owned….. That was until 3 weeks ago. You see we had demo days at the country club I work at.. They had Titleist, Ping, Cobra, and then this fellow from Adams.
Is this being closed out? Newer model on the way or is this a new price point strategy which sounds bogus to me. I ordered one that should be here today. Ther are coming out with a new model and getting these off the shelves. We are playing a 3 day tourney and boy is he in for a surprise! My advice to any prospective buyer; if you must have this club, go for the one with the neutral set-up.
I just want to know which one in the last pic is the a3 and which one is the a30s. Having reviewed this club earlier, let me add to it by expressing a bit of a disappointment in this club. Shortly after purchasing this club, well maybe about a month, the head loosened on the shaft during a round of golf. I took the club back to the dealer I bought it from and had their golfsmith reset the shaft and away we went.
That was about a month ago or so. Yesterday, while playing, it had slipped on the shaft again. The dealer offered to reset the shaft, or delivere to me a new one out of the box to replace it. I thought that since this club had exhibited the same problem twice, it had become a chronic problem.
I elected to have a new one provided in place of the defective unit. I love his driver, is accurate and long. If this problem arises with the new club, I think I will have to move on and try something different which I am not too keen on. We will see. Same thing with his fairway club, incredibly easy to get off the fairway and in the rough it really shines. I am still hopeful. I seemed to be mostly hitting it well but with little roll and occasionally pushes right and pulls left.
I brought my driver and hit balls as instructed and listened. The 9 deg w. R shaft was occasionally longer but the  At my swingspeed of mph, the ball speed was higher and the net yardage averaged 18 yds further than my current driver — less spin, hotter clubface and better trajectory. Just bought an Insight XTD a3 and immediately tried it at the range. With it, I consistently hit to yards, at least 20 yards more than my previous driver. Now looking forward to consistently beating alvin and bong.
Just wanted to say that I tried the Callaway FT-i driver. For the first time of my life I hit the ball so far out that I could not even see it start to come down. I got it with a stiff graphic shaft. There is no doubt everyone on the tee box will know you hit it well. Good job Adams. They are rated gold on the Hot List by Golf Digest. Has no feel to it at all. Might as well have a tin can on a wood stick. It has no feel to it at all.
Fantastic driver. The A3 suits my swing very well. Only problem is that after a month it came apart. Earlier today, my tee shot on the first hole ended with the head coming completely off and landing 30 yards to the right in some wooly rough. I was highly disapointed. I absolutely love this driver and feel it has really made a difference in my game this year. Has anybody had any experience dealing with them? I had the same problem see my earlier post.
After having the head reattached, it start to come off with a few rounds. My local golf toy store replaced with a new unit, and there have been NO issues with this one…best results with any driver I have used! This morning the head came off. Have the 3 Wood as well as the hybrids. Love the clubs so hope this one lasts longer.
I work at Golf Town and this was the most often defective product that we had to send back to Adams for a replacement. Way more than any other driver, even though we sell way more Taylormade or Callaway drivers than Adams. Many heads fly off the shaft and in several cases the shaft has broken near the hosel.
The shaft is worth more than what I paid for the club! I finished the fall season with no problems. Played a couple rounds this winter with no problems. They fixed the issue and were very easy to work with. Well whatever it was, they seemed to have fixed the issue. Hit balls plumb out of sight while not deviating too much from dead center. Hit one on the toe that only got out about yards, but the rest were carrying  This driver was made for you people who want to hit longest in their group and old fogies like me who need dependably long accurate driving to complement a great short game.
Hit a few in a field next to my house and I cannot believe how long it is. Going to play this weekend for the true test. Putters Wedges. Driver Fairway Wood Hybrid Putter. Driver Fairway Wood Hybrid.
