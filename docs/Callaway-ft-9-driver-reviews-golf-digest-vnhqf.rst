The replacement for the popular FT-5 driver has Hyperbolic Face Technology, which means the thickness of the face has been strategically designed to increase ball speed across the whole surface area. Building on the success of the previous FT-5, this FT-9 Driver from Callaway Golf has increased power with the introduction of Hyperbolic Face Cup Technology, strategic shaping of the face thickness to dramatically increase ball speeds across the whole face.
More power is transferred to the ball with the largest face of any Callaway Golf driver, plus increased MOI for shots hit high and low on the face, the FT-9 generates significantly more carry by improving ball flight on miss-hits. Contact: Web: www. The Ft-9 I feel sits more square at address and promotes a very good flight of the ball both into the wind and wnd assisted.
I am now learning to shape the ball much better with this club although I do have a natural draw flight I am now working on my fade and I feel that this driver has the ability along with myself to provide any shot that is required.
The shaft is very good too and I feel the kick point is very good for me and I would strongly recommend getting custom fitted for your driver as I had this done and I really feel that this is what I am benefiting from now.

Of equal importance is the weighting: the has a draw bias, the is neutral. This difference is subtle, but noticeable, especially for those that tend to miss towards the heel. The head launched just a hair higher and spun RPMs more. This makes sense due to the additional loft on the  I thought the PXv would be less accurate, but it was every bit as good as the Diamana. Project X has done a great job of balancing that shaft so that there is still some weight in the hands and feel for the club head in spite of the low total weight.
The big difference on the monitor was club head speed, ball speed, and distance. When the next ball flies farther than the last, why stop? On the course, the Optiforce was excellent. On well hit shots, I was definitely past the spots where my drives normally stop. As far as accuracy, I had plenty of confidence to hit the Optiforce on any hole where I would normally hit driver.
Going into this review, I expected the Optiforce to be inaccurate due to its light weight and long shaft. I expected that the additional shaft length and reduced weight would not give me additional club head speed.
And I expected the head with the Diamana shaft to perform best for me. The Optiforce is longer than my gamer. Forget the marketing, forget the weight, forget any notions of what you think fits you, and just go hit it. Cool website man! Read the articles, watched the video, great job! I currently have the Diablo and I have to remember to do a bunch of little adjustments with ball placement, hands, closing the face, etc.
I have been looking at adjustable drivers so I will be checking this one out. Hope everybody is well, take care. Adjustability is definitely the way to go. I think within 5 years, glued drivers will be completely gone, or a specialty item at best. I want to buy a new driver and im leaning towards the OptiForce after watching and reading your review but some of my friends swear the SLDR is better.
I just purchased my new FT-9 driver. In the begining I hit it good and straight, but not very long. I added an inch to my shaft and Wow, what a difference. Thiss driver is definitely one of the best callaway has made. It is more stabled on impact and is very long off the tee, once you get fitted correctly. It is a great driver… Go get one….. Xeno golfer: You are right, the FT5 sounds much nicer at impact, I got my 5 replaced by Callaway with a 9 and I have not been able to hit it.
I found an FT5 on Ebay and bought it and have renewed confidence off the tee. With the 9 I was just leaving it in the bag and hitting 3 wood. Hi got a FT9 as a present from my wife I was scared to try it but not dissapointed it is so forgiving and it gave me so much distance, I think Callaway will be my future clubs.
