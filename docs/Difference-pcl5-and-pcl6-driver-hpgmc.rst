Protocol Composition Logic PCL is a logic for proving security properties of network protocols that use public and symmetric key cryptography. This reduces the number of commands required to describe a graphics page. Most printers will have more than one page description language PDL aka print driver. PCL is probably the most well known driver out there.
PS and XPS are also popular. It describes the appearance of a printed page, mantaining its formatting, color and print quality settings. Because of that, print files generated with PS drivers can be portable among different printers without the file that will be printed lose quality, color definitions or formatting.
The printer must have a PS module that translates the PostScript commands. Both driver types groups the print commands and settings into the whole page, so if there's an error when processing the file, the whole page will be lost and you have to reprint the page you lost, or all the file, depending on the error. They're different of the PCL3 print language for most DeskJet printers , which separates the file in swaths - this is the reason why DeskJet printer don't need much memory; it has only the necessary to store the swath it's printing now.
Resulting: PCL3 always prints. This way we dont' have to send the same file down 50 million times from the mainframe. We can't find anything different about the original, and if we convert it using a normal print to file driver, it works fine. When we use a Lexmark Optra L driver it triples. The Optra driver is required, because of the flash features.
