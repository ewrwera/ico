It is a fairly straightforward process. You must get your Oklahoma license renewal in person at a DMV office, providing the paperwork needed and the money for the fees. There is no provision to so this online. After two years you will have to start over in the process, taking the written test, the driving test and a vision screening. People get a postcard reminder to renew their Oklahoma License 30 days after the expiration date.
You may still get an Oklahoma license renewal for up to two years after the expiration date as long as you still have the license. While it is required in almost all cases that you renew your license in person, if you are out of state at the time you may renew by mail under certain conditions.
To do this by mail your license must be current and in good standing. If there are any accidents on your driving record, or you have any physical issues, you may have to take the driving test and the written test again when you renew, regardless of the date.
Oklahoma is not as stringent as some states regarding the paperwork you need. You do have to prove United States citizenship, for instance but only when getting your first license. You do have to prove Oklahoma residence with two forms of identification. Your license that has not yet expired can be one of those pieces.
There are several things that can be used to prove residence, such as mail with your name and address on the envelope. You may pay for your license with a credit card or check. You must be able to prove your current address if it has changed since your last renewal. If you have a suspended license, you must get your driving privileges restored or wait until the suspension period ends.
At that point you may renew the license. Contact Information Office locations Contact Us. See Instruction learner's permits Also called Instruction permit.
