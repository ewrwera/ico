Driver updates will resolve any driver conflict issues with all devices and improve the performance of your PC. To fix your Drivers problems you will need to know the particular model of the Windows device you are having problems with. Once you have the details you can search the manufacturers website for your drivers and, if available, download and install these drivers.
In the search box on the taskbar, enter device manager , then select Device Manager. If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions. Right-click or press and hold the name of the device, and select Uninstall. If you can't see the desktop and instead see a blue, black, or blank screen, see Troubleshoot blue screen errors or Troubleshoot black or blank screen errors.
