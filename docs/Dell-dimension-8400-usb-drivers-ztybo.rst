How can I adjust color settings? Originally Dell MCE was shipped with version 2. That version had a bug that prevented MCE from properly detecting the type of cable service provided in certain areas. As a result MCE was picking the wrong channel-to-frequency table and therefore missing most of the channels and showing bad quality on the channels it found.
This bug was fixed in version 2. You can use this program to capture a file from any input and directly burn a DVD.
Despite the new technologies inside it, very little about the Dell Dimension 's case has changed in the three years since it was introduced as the Dimension  The same, rather dull, gray-and-black-plastic exterior opens up like an Oxford English Dictionary, the motherboard and the power supply are attached to one side, the drives on the other.
The latching mechanism still irritates us; it requires you to press buttons on both the top and the underside of the case. When you finally pry it open, the case takes up more desk space compared to a standard tower case with a removable side panel.
It's not until you open the Dimension that you'll be able to see the new features of Intel's X Express chipset. Once your eye leaves the processor's huge heat sink, you'll discover one of the prime benefits of the chipset: improved bus architecture.
The Dimension comes with one full-length 16X PCIe slot for the graphics card and one smaller 1X PCIe slot for upgrades such as Gigabit Ethernet cards and others, though cards for the 1x port have not yet been released.
Despite the extreme cooling tactics, the interior of the Dimension is much neater than the Dimension cases we've seen.
The X chipset minimises cable clutter by moving to the smaller Serial ATA cables for connecting hard drives, leaving only one IDE channel and its cumbersome ribbon cable for your optical drives. That's right, we said terabyte. Sadly, Dell also offers no media-card reader to aid interfacing with digital cameras and other devices. A flip-up panel on the front of the system hides an additional pair of USB 2.
You'll also find a pair of additional USB 2. An early adopter's delight, the Dell Dimension offers the same high-end flexibility as the Dimension but with a bevy of new components. Thanks to Intel's new X Express chipset, Dell is able to incorporate a 3. As is often the case with new PC technology, the hardware is significantly ahead of the software, so while these new parts have the potential to boost performance, and indeed the Dimension 's benchmark scores place it among the fastest PCs we've ever seen, you can expect even to reap greater benefits from the system as more-demanding software apps hit the market.
In the meantime, there's very little that the Dimension can't handle already. Connected to the system's Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2 sound card, the speakers produced crisp, nuanced audio on our tests. That Dell included a discrete sound card instead of relying on the X's new embedded 7. Keep an eye out for our upcoming analysis of the Azalea sound chip compared to other audio solutions in the coming months.
This amount might seem like more storage than you'd ever need, but each of the motherboard's four Serial ATA channels can support up to a GB hard drive, which means that GB represents less than 20 percent of the Dimension 's storage potential.
You can upgrade to two GB drives at the time of purchase, but Dell's online configurator does not allow you to upgrade to three or four hard drives, so any more storage will have to be an aftermarket upgrade. Other configuration options include an ATI TV tuner and the usual array of printers, larger monitors, and other products from Dell's catalog.
The unremarkable optical mouse and keyboard get the job done, although they don't look especially stylish doing it. At least the keyboard's multimedia buttons streamline the Dimension 's entertainment functions. Dell's Media Experience suite gives you apps for working with your digital media, such as music and photos. You'll also find Dell's Picture Studio 2. Corel's WordPerfect Office  Despite support for faster processors and memory, this next-generation technology does not demonstrate any performance advantage over older hardware with today's applications.
Until we see more-robust applications especially designed for Intel's newer CPU architecture, performance won't be that much different from the technology that is already on the market. The Dimension 's benchmark scores placed it among our highest-performing PCs.
The Dimension achieved a SysMark score of , about 13 percent faster than the last Dimension we reviewed. We can see that neither the DDR2 memory nor the faster 3. While the Dimension is a powerful system, it will need supporting software before the hardware reaches its full potential. This card marks a brand-new processor for ATI--and a huge performance boost. The most significant result is the 1,x1, Unreal Tournament test, with a score of  This performance increase is likely due to the graphics chip technology more than the new PCIe interface.
There are no games on the market yet that can truly take advantage of PCIe's increased bandwidth, so we expect that performance gains will be even greater as we see more-demanding software. Dell's huge setup guide makes assembling your Dimension even less strenuous than a walk in the park.
The well-written, well-illustrated user guide is not specific to this system, but in addition to basic info for the chassis, Dell has filled the book with hints, tips, and troubleshooting points for attaching printers, scanners, and other peripherals. There's also the Dell Solution Center software that links you to online for additional support resources and tech support by phone. If you break something that technical support clears as a problem you can't solve, onsite service will handle it during the first year.
You can add up to three additional years of onsite service for more money.
