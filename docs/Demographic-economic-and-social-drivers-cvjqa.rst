Nonetheless, the demographic dividend model can account for much variation in past economic performance among different countries and regions e. Latin America vs. For example, from to , Nepal, Jordan, Bhutan, and Eswatini are projected to experience the largest gains among countries in the ratios of their working-age to non-working-age populations.
The dependency ratio—the inverse of the working age to non-working-age ratio—measures the economic pressure working-age individuals face to support, in addition to themselves, those who are not of working age.
In , the ratio in more developed regions was appreciably lower than in less developed regions 0. But by , as a result of different patterns of fertility decline and population aging, the ratio had increased to 0. And by , the dependency ratio is projected to be greater in more developed regions 0. This switch suggests that in the coming decades, demographics will be more favorable to economic well-being in less developed regions than in more developed regions.
This will be especially true in Africa, the only region in which this ratio is projected to decline by  For countries that have yet to experience appreciable demographic transitions like Chad, the Central African Republic, Somalia, and Sierra Leone , policies are appropriately oriented toward catalyzing those transitions. Such policies include investment that promotes infant and child survival, such as expanded vaccine coverage as well as wider access to well-provisioned and appropriately staffed primary health care systems.
And countries with relatively sizable portions of the population concentrated in the high-work and high-savings part of the life cycle need policies to realize the potential benefits of favorable demographics. Such policies include support for the operation of competitive labor and capital markets, equipping workers with human capital, building infrastructure, sound macroeconomic management, carefully designed trade policies, and good governance.
Such policies are always desirable, but a large working-age population share raises the stakes. Population aging is the dominant demographic trend of the twenty-first century—a reflection of increasing longevity, declining fertility, and the progression of large cohorts to older ages. We expect to add 1 billion older individuals in the next three to four decades, atop the more than million older people we have today.
Although every country in the world will experience population aging, differences in the progression of this phenomenon will be considerable. Japan is currently the world leader, with 28 percent of its population 65 and over, triple the world average. By , 29 countries and territories will have larger elder shares than Japan has today. But by , Korea median age  Three decades ago, the world was populated by more than three times as many adolescents and young adults to year-olds as older people.
Three decades from now, those age groups will be roughly on par. By income group, the sharpest growth in the numbers of older people will occur in countries currently classified as middle income. This is unsurprising, as these countries make up 74 percent of the world population.
What may be surprising is that the older-population share in middle-income countries is increasing at a much faster rate than in their low- and high-income counterparts. This contradicts the common claim that developing economies are getting old before they get rich.
The challenge middle-income countries face is not predominantly insufficient income to take care of their older people. Rather, it is how well institutions and policies can promote economic and social security among older people in a financially sustainable way.
Population aging is sounding alarms worldwide. Economists continue to express concerns. These relate to downward pressure on economic growth due to labor and capital shortages and falling asset prices in the future as a growing and more aged cohort of older people seeks to support itself by liquidating investments. Another major issue has to do with fiscal stress. Government coffers will be strained by rising pension liabilities and the cost of health and long-term care associated with the expected growth in the incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases such as cancer, among others.
These challenges will, however, be partially offset by the increasing, but typically neglected, value older people create through productive nonmarket activities like volunteer work and caregiving. Without historical lessons from a world with such large numbers of older people, there is even more uncertainty about our collective future.
However, adopting a business-as-usual approach to the challenges of population aging would be irresponsible. Various responses could cushion the economic burden of population aging. These include policy reforms to promote the financial sustainability and intergenerational equity of health and pension financing.
Pronatalist tax incentives are also a policy option for the long term, but their effect on fertility is thus far unproven. Relaxing the institutional and economic barriers to international immigration from regions with relatively large working-age populations could alleviate labor shortages. Finally, technological innovations are likely to ameliorate the effects of population aging.
Institutional innovations like new models of home health care, public transportation systems, the design of urban layouts, and financial instruments are also on the horizon. Global, regional, and country demographic indicators have changed dramatically since the early s and are poised for equally dramatic changes in the coming decades.
Population aging continues to displace population growth as the focal point of interest among global demographic phenomena. Nonetheless, both phenomena and their underlying drivers have had, and will continue to have, profound repercussions for myriad indicators and determinants of economic well-being and progress.
Demographics are not, however, set in stone. Nor are their implications for individual and collective well-being. Continued population growth is, and should be, the foremost issue.
Anyone not understanding this should step aside, and not continue to mislead people. Beyond this key point, the subject of an aging population needs to be faced head-on, with some clear talk. And not look upon it as a problem. All rights reserved. Bloom Reprint Print.
