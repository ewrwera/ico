I got it to work by holding CTRL as soon as I saw windows loading, and holding it through windows startup. First, thank you for this guide. I have one problem which is unfortunately in the extremely important step. For some reason I can't get the repair command prompt console. Any ideas? Last year I upgraded to Win 7  I just experienced a bad infection that has caused me to reinstall Win 7.
My question is — can I go all the way back to vista and install the 64 version instead and then upgrade to Win 7 64? Hey, I'm having some trouble with last step. Any advice? First - thanks - works a treat. I've refurbished an older lap top with no recovery disks and a second hand hard drive and it runs like a dream now. Only issue I had was using the hotkeys and enter to open CMD as administrator.
On my 'host' machine it opens with restricted rights so it confused me for a moment got it right third time. But all I did was click on the start globe, type cmd in the search box and CMD comes up as the first result.
Right click on it and select 'run as administrator' and it's no longer an issue. Reply 7 years ago on Introduction. The guide for Vista has an important step that you do not have to do when installing Windows 7 or 8. So no, it's not the same as the other guides if that is your question. Add a comment.

So how do I do that -- can I do it once I get to the command prompt? Go to the motherboard manufacturer's website and find the raid drivers.
