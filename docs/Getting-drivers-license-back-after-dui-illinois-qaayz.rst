Having one or two drinks with friends may seem harmless, but if you decide to drive and are pulled over by police, you could be facing driving under the influence DUI charges that carry serious penalties in Illinois. Being able to drive means being able to gain an education and support your family. The loss of your right to drive is a direct loss of freedom, which for many people seems unbearable. These experienced attorneys can explain your rights, options, and how to best defend against losing your license.
There are two kinds of license suspensions that you may face if you drive under the influence. If your blood alcohol concentration BAC level is. If you fail or refuse a breathalyzer test, regardless of the status of criminal charges, you may face a civil statutory summary suspension of your license.
A statutory summary suspension is an administrative process that results in civil consequences of license suspension if you fail or refuse a breathalyzer test. If you failed a BAC test , you will automatically have your license suspended under the Illinois statutory summary suspension law. While the U. You can drive until day 45, but then you are not allowed behind the wheel until the suspension is lifted or completed.
Depending on whether this is your first or subsequent offense, the length of suspension may vary. For example, if you were arrested for a DWI , ultimately acquitted in court, and then later arrested again for the current DWI conviction you got, the DMV will see all of that.
Your first arrest will be held against you, despite the acquittal. Your attorney will then find and assemble all the paperwork you received during the course of your arrest s , conviction, disposition, treatment, or recommendations; Any piece of paper you have regarding your case could be important, or at least useful. The DMV will know what is in the police report, and so should you.
Third, AA, treatment, and family or friends; To get your privilege to drive restored, or allowed on a restricted basis RDP: Restricted Driving Permit , there is going to be a hearing, held in a DMV office, by a representative of the state and a DMV official, or judge. At that hearing, your attorney and the hearing officers are going to need a few things:. Once you have the required documents, your attorney will submit a request to the DMV for a hearing.
Once you apply, it usually takes a few weeks to get a hearing date, which will be set to occur two to three months after you get notified. Before the actual, formal hearing, the DMV has a resource available the best thing the DMV has ever done , called an informal hearing.
Consider this a pre-hearing conference. Many, but not all, DMV offices, have a representative standing by, called an Informal Hearing Officer, who will sit down with you, go over your documents with you, and tell you what is missing or still needs to be done, before your hearing should take place.
These officers are typically available on a walk-in basis, but definitely call your local DMV ahead of time, before just showing-up. License reinstatement hearings will occur in a small room, at a DMV office, where evidence will be presented by you, and the state, before a formal hearing officer.
This is a perfunctory trial setting. Documents sent to you by the DMV, before your hearing, will give you a pretty good idea what to expect to be asked about. Mostly, the process is a review of your history, your behavior leading up to, and including your arrest and conviction , and what you have done since. You will have an opportunity to speak and be heard, as will your attorney, if you have one. After that, you wait. With the decision, will come a list of things you must do, based on your case, before you can begin driving.
Before a driver can determine his or her eligibility date, the length of revocation must also be taken into account. The minimum length of revocation depends on the number of DUI convictions the person has had:. The driver must separately determine the termination date of both the SSS and the revocation.
Drivers should remember that regardless of the calculated date, the SSS does not terminate until the required reinstatement fee is paid. Further, the revocation does not terminate, regardless of the eligibility date, until the person has received a favorable decision for reinstatement after an administrative hearing before the Office of the Secretary of State. Finally, if the driver has 4 or more DUI convictions and is an Illinois resident, he or she is never eligible for full reinstatement.
This is known as a lifetime revocation.
