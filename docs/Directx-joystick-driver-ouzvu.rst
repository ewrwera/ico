All non-IBM standard joysticks, such as digital joysticks, MIDI joysticks, and analog joysticks driven by joystick accelerators must provide a joystick minidriver in addition to custom registry information.
A joystick OEM can write a minidriver that provides access to nonstandard joystick hardware. This provides a mechanism for digital joysticks to work with any Windows-based game that uses the joystick application programming interface API.
The driver model can deal with up to six axes, a POV hat, and a double word of buttons, so that an OEM can easily create a minidriver for new hardware with a higher degree of freedom than the current game port allows.
The joystick minidriver provides complete flexibility to hardware vendors and allows game creators to use the installed base with their titles. Brakes and clutch may use joystick axis. There are many variations out there. Joysticks also can have a lot of jitter. You can see this if you tweak the Reader code to open a real physical joystick you have laying around. Joysticks also report stick deflection in as a linear value, and this is why games have axis curves.
Linear values can be really frustrating to use by end-users. A virtual joystick driver has none of these problems. The value you send to the driver is the value the driver consumer a game? You can deadzone, smooth and curve the data all you want and then send it to the joystick driver.
