That was really helpful…. I almost spent half a day trying to sort it out, now it is working fine Thanks. I could solve my problems with DriverPackage thanks to your tutorial.
I believe this is the best way to do this…. Dear, you saved my time and my money by reading your post. This trick was very easy and helpful to me Many thanks. Thank you so much for this great info.
I was able to slipstream the drivers using Nlite and install XP Professional on my laptop. I have never done this before and it was really pretty easy and your instructions were excellent. Your instructions to integrate raid drivers was easy and not hard to understand , thank you very much for all the information. This was a lifesaver. Saved me lot of headache and pain. What a relief!!!! I am absolutely amazed at the nlite software.
It is wonderful free utility. I was almost going to buy a pack of floppy disk and external floppy drive. Saved me money! Excellent demonstration. You should definitely be compensated for saving all of us further headache and pain. I would not mind donating. It helped having clear and concise directions.
I hope someone else in the same situation finds these directions.. Thanks a million. I am really happy. I dont know how to thank you.
And by the way, good luck for you all. It really helps me much. Thank you again. I just want to say thanks, your tutorial help me out with the headache i had. It works fine Thanks for your support. Wow, perfect tutorial. Wasted hours to try with a floppy disk, driver would load with F6 in setup, but wouldnt after the XP setup started to copy the files to the hard drive.
Thanks for the help! This article helped me tremendously. Don't put them inside a folder, put them on the root of the floppy. You want to boot from the CD, not the floppy, so if the system tries to boot from the floppy, either leave it out until setup starts to load from the CD, or change the boot order in the BIOS. One of the first things you'll see is the above option to press F6.
Do so. After a couple of minutes, you'll be given the option to load your own drivers. Once you see the above screen, hit 's' to specify your own driver.
Setup will search the floppy disk. You'll be presented with a list of available drivers to load off the disk. Select the required driver and hit enter. You can go through this process more than once if you need to. Once Setup lists all the additional drivers you want, carry on as you would with a normal Windows XP installation.
