Its host of standard driver assists and innovative features—including an in-bed trunk and a multifunction tailgate—further bolster the Ridgeline's status as the truck equivalent of a Swiss Army knife and earned it an Editors' Choice award.
Before the model year, people could say the Ridgeline looked like a lot of things, but rugged wasn't one of them. We're not sure that the mid-size truck's makeover — which includes a fresh design from the front roof pillars forward—will quiet all the haters, but it definitely looks bolder than before.
Enhancing this fresh aesthetic is a new package from Honda Performance Development HPD that's available on all trim levels and adds black overfenders, a distinctive blacked-out grille, HPD graphics on the bed walls, and cool-looking bronze wheels. Non-HPD models get a standard set of newly designed inch wheels with more aggressive all-terrain tires and reduced backspacing that gives the Ridgeline a wider track and a broader stance.
Inside, there is a smattering of subtle changes, but the biggest update is the revised infotainment system. Along with improved graphics and screen icons that Honda says are easier to use, the Ridgeline now comes with a physical volume knob, addressing our years of complaints.
All-wheel drive is now standard. This segment of mid-size trucks has become oversaturated with traditional body-on-frame pickups that provide ample towing and capable off-roading.
However, the Ridgeline caters to folks who want a more comfortable and fuel-efficient alternative. While the priciest models have the fanciest features, we think the RTL has the best mix of desirable equipment and value. These include heated front seats, a leather-trimmed interior, and power-adjustable front seats. The lone powertrain is a hp 3. The engine feels smooth, and throttle response is especially receptive when you call for hard acceleration.
Despite an unremarkable design, the materials are attractive enough and the controls are nicely organized—although we'd like more knobs and buttons instead of touchscreen controls. The front seats are wide and comfortable, with a handy armrest that can be adjusted for optimal comfort.
The back seat is also roomy and allows the Passport to transport up to five people. There's 41 cubic feet of storage space behind the rear seat, which held 15 of our carry-on suitcases. Folding that row unlocks 78 cubes of room and the capacity to carry 33 bags total. Interior cubby storage in general is great thanks to useful bins throughout the cabin and a huge center-console bin.
Every Passport sports an 8. It also includes necessities such as Bluetooth and various power points. However, those who want a volt outlet, built-in navigation, an upgraded audio system, a Wi-Fi hotspot, and wireless phone charging will have to pony up for the top-tier Touring and Elite models.
Every model has a host of driver-assistance technology , such as forward-collision warning and automated emergency braking. Key safety features include:. Shifting the six-speed manual is fun thanks to short throws and light action. One of the notable additions to the new Si is a rev-matching system, which was previously available only on the Civic Type R.
It works well and is easily turned off via a menu in the touchscreen if you prefer to heel-and-toe yourself. As before, the Si has a stiffer suspension and larger brake rotors compared with the base sedan; harder, better, faster, stronger—you get the idea.
Its responses are noticeably sharper than the standard car's thanks to eager turn-in, heavier steering, and a brake pedal with good bite. A limited-slip differential is also standard equipment, and Honda has expanded the drive-mode selector to include a customizable Individual mode in addition to the previous Normal and Sport modes.
It allows you to combine the quicker throttle response of Sport mode with the lighter steering of Normal mode or vice versa. Honda has removed the previous model's adaptive dampers, but we didn't miss them too much, as the standard suspension tune—at least on smooth California canyon roads—is satisfyingly firm without being harsh.
Honda is attempting to justify this with more standard equipment. The Si now has a larger touchscreen, blind-spot monitoring, and an upgraded audio system. Base LX models come with a 5.
The Honda also comes standard with a suite of driver-assistance technology to help prevent collisions from happening in the first place. Key safety features include:. Honda covers every CR-V with limited and powertrain warranties that are competitive with most other manufacturers. The Hyundai Tucson and Kia Sportage are the exceptions, besting Honda and company with an unrivaled year or ,mile powertrain warranty.
Their limited warranty is significantly better, too. More Features and Specs. New Cars. Buyer's Guide. Type keyword s to search.
