QSqlDatabasePrivate::addDatabase: duplicate connection name 'digikamDatabase', old connection removed. This suggests that for some reason digiKam is not able to use sqlite. Other packages, such as Thunderbird, do not have any problems with sqlite. I know there is sqlite and sqlite3. Perhaps that is related.

Searches on the net have yielded nothing for this company. Google searches for this model number have resulted in various site where I can buy this cam or one like it but no links for drivers or software can be found. It is a very basic and cheap cam but there are pics on it that I would like to retrieve.
Thanks for any input you may have. Posted 03 June - AM Is this it? Did your friends pass through Indonesia recently? Posted 04 June - PM thanks for the response Rimmer. I found that site also, but the links didn't work for me either.
The cam actually came from "selectyourgifts. I have since revisited the site but with no response from them. Soooo, here I am. Is Indonesia where the cam is made? If you are unsure of whether or not you need to update your Drivers, or indeed which Drivers may need to be updated, you can run a Drivers scan using a driver update tool you will need to pay to register this tool but usually the Drivers scan is free.
This will allow you to assess your Driver needs without any commitment. Alternatively, you can use the device manager to check if there are problems with any of your hardware devices. In many cases the answer to this is yes, however in some cases the manufacturers no longer make the Drivers available so you need to use a Driver Update Tool to install the missing Drivers.
