Beginning driver Ashley Crawford grips the worn gray steering wheel and warily begins maneuvering the Ford Escort through a set of bright orange traffic cones outside Killian Senior High School. She considers herself lucky: Because of budget cuts, many schools around the country are leaving driver's ed by the roadside.
They are cutting back on behind-the-wheel instruction or eliminating it altogether, leaving it to parents to either teach their teenagers themselves or send them to commercial driving schools. Even for those who can do it, the combination of parents, teenagers and learning how to drive can be volatile.
In more than half the states, minors who want a license must take driver's education from a certified instructor, said Allen Robinson, CEO of the American Driver and Traffic Safety Education Association.
However, that doesn't necessarily mean schools are required to offer a class. Generally, after age 18, would-be drivers do not have to undergo any formal instruction. The more recent cutbacks have been driven by school funding shortages, and the trend might be accelerating because of the downturn in the economy, said J.
Robinson said the nation's schools have all but eliminated driver's ed as an elective course offered during the school day. Here in Miami-Dade County, the nation's fourth-largest school system got rid of driver's ed during the day at all but Killian and another school.
Funding formulas for supplies, materials and textbooks are typically based on enrollments or staff positions as well. Some districts have very detailed distribution procedures, providing separate formulas for each item or group of items, while other districts provide a lump sum payment, usually based on enrollment, for schools to purchase these items as they see fit. Central control over supplies, materials and textbooks often extends beyond these distribution formulas as well, with schools being required to purchase items through a central purchasing system.
Centrally Controlled Budget Categories. As indicated above, school district budgeting is a very top down process. The first indicator of this is the centralized budgeting systems most school districts use. Budget categories are generally determined and established by the central office, and school expenditures need to fit into one of those categories to be approved. Many forms of educational technology are relatively new, and often, school districts simply have not developed spending categories to accommodate these new expenditures.
Moreover, traditional models for allocating resources may not work as well for technology given the demand for expenditures over time in some instances. The problem is most educational expenditures occur on an annual basis. Those that don't, tend to recur at long intervals i. For example, most expenditures at a school site are for instructional programs, and the largest single component of those expenditures is for teacher compensation.
These expenditures are needed each year, in roughly equal amounts. Moreover, changes have more to do with the enrollment of the school than they do with differing instructional needs from year to year.
Consequently, it is relatively easy for the district to establish central budgeting categories within which all expenditures must be budgeted and recorded. Many forms of educational technology, in particular computers, require large expenditures every three to five years, a time frame not usually considered in educational planning.
As a result, few school district budget systems can accommodate such expenditures. One way to solve this problem from a school perspective is to carry over revenues from one year to the next. The problem is most school budget and funding systems don't allow schools to do this. If the funds are not spent the year they are allocated to the school, they are taken back by the district.
Changing systems like this has proven quite difficult in the past, although some districts now allow schools to carry over some funds. Another problem facing many districts is the issue of equity. Districts typically try to allocate resources to schools on an equal basis hoping to avoid charges of bias. This makes systems that provide "start-up" capital, or revolving sums of money for purchase of new computers invisible in school districts, and something not likely to be implemented in the near future.
Pay Scales. While pay scales do not appear to be a problem in budgeting, they are related to job descriptions and personnel systems. The problem is that many programs create the need for employees with differing job skills and titles, particularly at school sites. For example, until recently there was no need for a system operator or computer repair technician at most school sites.
Yet today, keeping a school wide network, or even a single computer lab operating requires substantial attention from someone skilled in computer networking and repair. Often district personnel systems take a long time to establish new positions or job titles, seriously limiting the flexibility a school has in hiring qualified individuals. As a result, teachers attempt to take on these responsibilities in addition to, or in place of their teaching load, often doing both at less than optimal efficiency.
Summar y. School district budgets typically take the form of line-item budgets, indicating how much will be spent on individual objects such as teachers, other personnel, maintenance and operations, capital outlay, and others.
More sophisticated school district budgets can track expenditures on these objects by function e. Many districts have the ability to track expenditures by school building, and some are beginning to keep track of educational resources by school level -- elementary, intermediate or high school -- or even at the secondary level by academic program.
Unfortunately, examples of these sophisticated budgeting systems are few and far between. Generally, budgets relating to driver education in public schools include the following categories:. Should your student's instructor not be able to provide your student with his or her behind-the-wheel lesson due to instructor illness, another instructor who is not experiencing any illness symptoms will be assigned to your student.
Classroom Sessions. During the COVID 19 Pandemic we are offering online, virtual classroom sessions instead of the typical in-person classroom sessions that typically take place at our school. This will allow for students to take the classroom portion of the drivers education program without the worry of exposure to COVID Please see the course calendar to sign up for classroom session one and classroom session two. Please feel free to contact Budget Driving School at if we can answer any of your questions around keeping our students, employees and guests safe during the COVID outbreak.
As always, we appreciate your business and look forward to providing drivers' education to all of you! Due to the length of time it takes to disinfect vehicles before and after each student has been given a lesson we can no longer pickup and return students to the following areas: Fountain Inn, Simpsonville, Mauldin, Blue Ridge, Easley, Southern Greenville County , Piedmont or Powdersville.
We are happy to still services students who live in these areas, but will need to make arrangements to have them brought to our office for the behind the wheel sessions. Office, Classroom and Testing location:. Monday - Friday: a.
