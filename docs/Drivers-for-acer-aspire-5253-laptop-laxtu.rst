Restart and reset are two very different things, but both can come in handy if you're having networking problems or poor Wi-Fi performance. If your Wi-Fi router hasn't been powered down in a while, try restarting the router to flush out anything that could be causing hiccups. This is definitely something to try if the no network connection problem happens sporadically or after a heavy load like Netflix streaming.
If restarting the router doesn't fix the problem, try resetting the router's software to restore it all back to factory default settings. This will permanently erase all the customizations you may have made on it, like the Wi-Fi password and other settings. Normally, this name is stored on any device that previously connected to it, but if it's not saved any longer, for whatever reason, then your phone or other wireless device will not automatically connect to it.
Check the SSID that the device is trying to connect to and make sure it's the right one for the network you need access to. Some SSIDs are hidden, so if that's the case, you'll have to manually enter the SSID information yourself instead of just select it from a list of available networks. On this note, the SSID is only part of what's required to successfully connect to a network.
If the connection fails when you try, and you know the SSID is right, double-check the password to ensure that it matches up with the password configured on the router. You might need to speak with the network administrator to get this. If you reset the router during Step 3, the router might not even have Wi-Fi turned on anymore, in which case you'll need to complete that before trying to connect to it.
If the reset router is broadcasting Wi-Fi, it's no longer using the previous SSID you used with it, so keep that in mind if you can't find it from the list of networks. Most wireless routers are set up as DHCP servers, which allow computers and other client devices to join the network so their IP addresses don't have to be manually set up. If it's not getting an address automatically, then it's likely using a static IP address, which can cause problems if the network isn't set up that way.
You can do this in Windows by running the control netconnections command-line command via Run or Command Prompt. Right-click the wireless network adapter and enter its properties and then IPv4 or IPv6 options to check how the IP address is being obtained.
Tap the i next to the network that's experiencing the wireless connection issue, and make sure the Configure IP option is set up appropriate, with Automatic chosen if it's supposed to use DHCP, or Manual if that's necessary.
