Raka, Reham. Let one of our students explain. Safeway partners with school districts throughout the metro area. With years of experience and with most of the largest school districts in the State, we look forward to discussing how our program could benefit your school district.
We provide classroom driving lessons and behind-the-wheel lessons for teens at locations throughout the Minneapolis and St. Paul metro area. Our goal is to educate our students to become safe and skillful drivers. Anthony St.
Students can register for individual missed classroom lessons by logging into their student account.
More recent students will also need to enter a PIN. We are also happy to help over the phone by calling our office during business hours. Please note, students must miss the lesson before they can register for a make-up lesson. Make-up lessons cannot be arranged in advance. The app is currently being modified to be compatible with iOS 14, at which time this link will be live. Please check back for updates. Important Customer Information View.
