Minnesota Vikings: going from great to mesmerizing Overlooked by most: Jake Reed's four 1,yard seasons from  Cris Carter's sidekick was one of the best WR2s of the '90s; he became an auxiliary piece of a more memorable corps in  Upon drafting Randy Moss in the '98 first round, the Vikings went to a rarely seen level.
Both Carter and Reed were in their 30s by this point, but Moss took over as defenses' top containment responsibility. His 17 TD receptions broke John Jefferson's rookie-year record by four. Moss, Carter and Reed guided Minnesota to a then-record points in  Carter and Moss earned All-Pro honors during the trio's two seasons together.
Brady in 4, yards, 50 TDs, made the Pro Bowl among other awards. The Patriots sent the Raiders a fourth-round pick for Moss, transforming their offense. His record 23 TD grabs have not been approached since. Stallworth was gone after the Pats' season, but it is difficult to eclipse the work of the team's receivers. Meric-Getty Images.
The Saints' passing attack funneled through seventh-round pick Marques Colston for years. Somehow, Colston never made a Pro Bowl. But the six-time 1,yard wideout is far and away the Saints' career receiving leader. His top wingmen -- deep threat Devery Henderson, mid-range target Lance Moore and former first-rounder Robert Meachem -- gave the Saints a balanced group that helped Brees to three passing titles in its five seasons together.
New York Giants: making one season count New York's wideout trio played vital roles in the team's fourth Super Bowl title. Victor Cruz went undrafted, dominated in a preseason game, disappeared, then resurfaced with 1, yards in  That remains second all time for a single postseason. Although Eli Manning's throw received more attention, Mario Manningham made a rather difficult catch to lift the Giants past the Patriots in their ultimate-game rematch. Manningham left in , and injuries derailed Nicks early.
But the group's masterpiece lives on. An undrafted free agent that landed with the team for which his father scouted, George Sauer was the Jets' All-Pro receiver in and '68, beating out his Hall of Fame teammate. The 6-foot-2 target provided a strong complement to Maynard, whose long-range chops were perfect for Namath.
Working together in the late '60s, Maynard and Sauer combined for eight Pro Bowls during their six years as teammates. He received help from a receiver consolidation that included Hall of Famer Tommy McDonald and the versatile Pete Retzlaff, who retired as the Eagles' receiving leader.
Philly also had veteran end Bobby Walston and employed this trio from  Retzlaff moved from fullback to wideout to tight end, working as an imposing receiver for most of his Eagles tenure. He complemented the diminutive McDonald well.
All three made the Pro Bowl in , when the Eagles became the only team to beat Vince Lombardi's Packers in a title game. Pittsburgh Steelers: no need to overthink this Look at the Steelers' receiving corps before automatically assuming their John Stallworth-Lynn Swann tandem is the open-and-shut pick. That said, these two are in the Hall of Fame and won four Super Bowls.
But when the "Mel Blount Rule" -- named after a Swann-Stallworth practice opponent -- took effect in , the receivers helped the Steelers transform into a lethal passing squad. The wideouts combined for 19 playoff TDs during their 10 seasons together, submitting storied Super Bowl moments. No other post-merger receiver has more than five such honors. With him for most of that span: third-rounder John Taylor.
Taylor did not join him as a starter until after his game-winning Super Bowl XXIII catch but made the Pro Bowl as a receiver in and totaled two 1,yard seasons. Taylor had a game in Anaheim with two yard touchdowns, and he scored six playoff TDs. Seattle Seahawks: Russ becomes Russ Russell Wilson was not viewed as a top-tier quarterback until  Slot maven Doug Baldwin caught 14 of those tosses that year, breaking into the ranks of the league's best receivers and making the Pro Bowl in  Lockett did not fully emerge until Baldwin's injury led to retirement, but he was a key piece from the jump.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers: fostering Fitzmagic Chris Godwin broke out in , but the Bucs deployed a better group a year earlier. Mike Evans: also good. D-Jax did not click with Jameis Winston like he did with part-time starter Ryan Fitzpatrick, but he and Humphries yards in made this one of the s' deepest positions.
Fitzpatrick's 9. Winston, however, certainly worked well with Evans, whose 1, receiving yards in are by far his best. This foursome played together from , made the playoffs every year and had each member make at least one Pro Bowl. Three Oiler receivers did so in , which came after back-to-back Moon passing titles.
After 21 Titan seasons in friendlier passing eras, Givins, Jeffires and Hill still reside atop the franchise's catches and yardage marks. Art Monk, Gary Clark and Ricky Sanders combined for 10 1,yard seasons in their seven years together  Showing rare across-the-board capabilities, each "Posse" member topped 1, yards at least twice during this run. The 5-foot-9 Clark resides as one of the more underrated wideouts, four times ranking in the top five in receiving yardage.

Finally, DE Mike Neal bulled his way into the backfield for what would have been a significant tackle for loss on a running play. In 7-on-7, on the very first snap, S Nick Collins made a difficult, diving INT on a ball that deflected off the outstretched arms of Driver.
K Mason Crosby got off to a great start in a progressive FG period, but lost his touch at the end. He hit five straight FGs from distances of 20, 33, 35, 39 and 46 yards, with the yarder going straight into the elevated camera pit behind the goalposts. But then he missed wide right from 50 yards and wide left from 50 again before drilling a yarder to finish 6-of More significant action in the final team periods included a nice pass break-up by CB Tramon Williams on a Rodgers deep ball to Driver.
A couple of snaps later, Rodgers found Jennings on a deep in route for a big gain on third down. With the offense working on 4-minute situations late in the game, trying to move the ball to run out the clock , rookie RB Quinn Porter made a couple of nice cuts and broke free for what would have been an plus-yard TD run.
Only in the 4-minute offense situation, Porter should have taken a knee when he got close to the goal line rather than score. Brandon Lloyd had a comeback year and did it in style, making his second appearance on this list already. This is very painful to witness as a Bears fan who watched Lloyd fail to separate himself from such competition as Marty Booker, Devin Hester and Rashied Davis.
However, I also feel the pain of Washington Redskins fans who had to bear no pun intended through watching Lloyd play horrendously for them, yet blossoming with the Broncos. Just to put into perspective, in the three years he played for Washington and Chicago, he accumulated 51 receptions for yards and two touchdowns.
Last year alone for Denver, Lloyd caught 77 passes, led the league with1, yards receiving and scored 11 TD's. Blistering pace. Greatest kick returner of all time. Hurdling over Todd Sauerbrun on the way to the end zone. However, spectacular catch probably doesn't make the top ten.
A rare display of great receiving skills by Hester makes you think he may actually be able to play as a starting receiver in the NFL. Sidney Rice vs Buffalo Sidney Rice is the prototypical wide receiver who you can throw a ball up and he will beat the defender.
Now when a quarterback finds himself one of these weapons, they can result to throwing them passes no matter what coverage, such as having two defenders within a couple of inches of the player. Any quarterback coach will tell you that you should not try to force the ball into what is perfect coverage from Leodis McKelvin.
Sidney Rice makes an incredible catch, going over the shoulder of McKelvin and having on after the safety comes in with a hit. Now we are in the top 15, I imagine most of you won't be reading what I put here, so I'll keep it short and sweet.
Jericho Cotchery vs Cleveland Now, if this catch wasn't good enough as it is, Cotchery pulls up with a tweaked hamstring. No he could have gone for the Albert Haynesworth way out and just lie on the floor and watch the rest of the play develop, but he's a man, and men don't do that take note Albert!
Little known fact, Cotchery was born with six fingers on his left hand. Before you ask, it was removed well before this catch, though it would of explained how he made this catch. Hakeem Nicks could have caught this with two hands. It would have been less hassle, it would have been easier and the success rate of the pass would be much greater. Instead, Nicks used what looks like his spidey senses to shoot a web from his hand, corral the ball and catch the pass.
Side note, this is the third reception on this list against the Dallas Cowboys. Now that's just bad luck! Brandon Tate vs Chicago Not many of you would have seen this catch. Or at least i didn't on my online stream. New England were dominating this game and just after half time, the bad people at CBS switched games.
As demoralising as it was as a Chicago fan, it proved CBS wrong as they missed this outstanding diving catch by Brandon Tate. Davone Bess vs New England Again, last game of the season, blowout victory again for New England, so not many people will have seen this.
Like I said before, I'm a sucker for one-handed grabs and this was sublime. The elegance of Bess when he leaps up and bring the ball in is something reminiscent of a ballet dancer. Now, this was the only video I could find of the catch, which is a travesty.
You never really get a good camera shot of the catch, but the catch is jaw dropping. I could practise that all day, and I could never accomplish that. Then you throw a defender who is on your back, and it seems physically impossible. Jimmy Graham vs Baltimore I'm going to try and get through this without mentioning basketball. Jimmy Graham is a match-up nightmare.
You can't put a linebacker on him because of the his 4. Now Jeremy Shockey is gone, Jimmy Graham will be a breakout contender this year not only for New Orleans but for your fantasy team. Also, this catch is pretty nice. That wasn't hard.
Now why does every commentator have to mention his basketball background or liken what he does to something in basketball whenever he catches a pass?! Marcedes Lewis vs Indianapolis As hard as this may be to believe, this catch is harder to make than it looks. Lewis is running inside towards the safety and knows one of two thing are going to happen.
