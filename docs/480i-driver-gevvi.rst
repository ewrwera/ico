The same two overachieving engines offered in the 3-series are available in the 4-series. Models designated i are powered by a hp turbocharged 2. The Mi is powered by a silky-smooth turbocharged 3. The 4-series provides a sporty driving experience, courtesy of a retuned suspension, a more-aggressive steering calibration, a wider rear track, and a lower center of gravity than the 3-series sedan.
Still, we tested the Mi coupe and came away less impressed with its driving character than its terrific inline-six. Apart from strong brakes that performed well in our to-zero-mph test feet , the Bimmer's rubbery steering and compliant ride didn't deliver the same satisfaction we got from the Mi sedan.
During our test drive of an all-wheel drive i xDrive model , we noted decent power from the turbocharged four-cylinder but came away with a similar complaint about the car's too-soft suspension. The EPA estimates the four-cylinder i coupe will earn 26 mpg in the city and 34 mpg on the highway. Adding all-wheel drive into the equation drops those figures to 24 and 33 mpg, respectively.
The six-cylinder Mi is rated at 22 mpg city and 31 highway. We haven't tested the Mi model on our mph highway fuel-economy route , but the i xDrive delivered 34 mpg over the mile test. For more information about the 4-series's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website. Shoppers may not notice much difference between the cabins of the 4-series and the 3-series unless they're in the back seat.
