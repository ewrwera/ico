That being said, a short Python snippet is all you need to dump the raw data coming in from the device. Check out the demo video after the break which features a joystick button mapper written in Python. I built one of those for a tv remote, but it looks like I used struct. I thing we require one driver program for reading ASTM message coming from analyzer.

BUT: You could write a compiler that translates Python code to machine language. Mark Lutton Mark Lutton 6, 7 7 gold badges 37 37 silver badges 54 54 bronze badges.
Or talk Microsoft into including a Python interpreter in the kernel. Technically, there's no reason why it couldn't be done.
Windows just doesn't currently offer you a lot of support for it. David Cournapeau David Cournapeau  I was thinking the same thing. It'd be perfect for writing a driver for a baud modem. Judge Maygarden, I can't see writing drivers in Lua either.
C or assembly makes the most sense. If you don't do it in a language close to the metal, I don't see why one interpreted language would be very superior to another. But you know what would be cool? A language that looks like Python but is procedural like C. Never say never but eh.. Mendelt Mendelt  What about integrating the interpreter written in C into the driver and then executing Python script also stored in the driver as data? Judge Maygarden: That might work in user-mode but kernel-mode is very restrictive on what calls can be made.
Chances are your interpreter will not run there either. Kernel mode development is kind of a black art. No they cannot. Windows drivers must be written in a language that can Interface with the C based API Compile down to machine code Then again, there's nothing stopping you from writing a compiler that translates python to machine code ;.

The FTDI Application Note states that the output is clocked at 16 times the baud rate, so baud should result in a timing of 6. However, on an FTH module the time was measured as  Unused inputs float high, and the last output command drove the ADBUS0 output low, so the value printed is in a list, [].

Thanks for your examples of how to use some of the FTDI libraries. Those are available in Python, too. Not sure if that might solve the 2. You are commenting using your WordPress. You are commenting using your Google account. You are commenting using your Twitter account.
