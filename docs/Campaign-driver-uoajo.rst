Phil Murphy, nearly lost a re-election that polls and political experts in the Garden State long had predicted as an easy victory. It was anything but: Murphy was finally projected as winner on Wednesday evening when he was up by only 19, votes over his Republican challenger out of more than 2. Durr said he entered the race after being denied a concealed carry permit despite having a clean record.
But even if true, that number microscopic considering the tremors he just sent through state politics. Aside from occasional yard signs seen in and around Durr's hometown of Logan, and knocking on doors, there wasn't much to the campaign itself for the projected winner. Durr's modest house near a highway in Gloucester County, still bedecked with campaign signs and a Gadsden "Don't Tread on Me" flag, served as the nerve center of the campaign. It didn't happen because of me, I'm nobody.
I'm absolutely nobody, I'm just a simple guy," he said. Durr called the past couple of days "a whirlwind, kind of surreal. Durr's unprecedented win coincided with boosted GOP turnout even in an off-year election that saw Republicans make gains across the state.
His victory netted about 3 percent more votes than Sweeney did in in unofficial returns.

All the images that they thought of a horse and what they were trying to emulate were graceful, but fast, strong and flexible, and kind of dangerous.
It all seemed really exciting and ambitious. We only have 45 minutes to get it, swimming in the ocean. Horses can only do so many laps, so you have like five horses that all have different personalities and relationships to swimming and some are more willing than others. You're doing it with scuba divers who are battling technology and communicating with you—I was not wearing a headset—and all of those things made it really challenging.
Well, I like its subtlety. Actually, when we were making it we didn't have it yet because they were still developing it and I've only gotten it recently. The themes that we talked about at the beginning were completely dismissed when we were making it because it's not really something that you can embody.
The images kind of do the work for you of it feeling transformative or strong but also subtle, all these things that seemed to be at odds with each other. I think they did an amazing job putting it in a scent. I would just keep going back to things that are strong but subtle.
