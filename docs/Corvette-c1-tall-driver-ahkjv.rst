These enthusiasts will also appreciate the excellent view of the dashboard instruments and an easier entry and exit to their classic car. An eccentric hub lifts the steering wheel up from the center steering shaft, offering two advantages:. In combination with a smaller diameter steering wheel the legroom increases even more and the view of the gauges remains intact.
Cars such as the Porsche Carrera and Ferrari were supplied from the factory with eccentric steering wheels. For example: an original Porsche eccentric steering wheel is 38cm diameter. If it is replaced by a 36cm unit, that is not eccentric, the legroom will be identical 2cm less diameter means 1cm more legroom but since the steering wheel is not eccentric it is not lifted 1cm like the original. The situation at the top of the steering rim is worse 1cm less diameter and 1cm lower due to the non eccentric hub gives a full 2cm less view of the gauges Replacement wheel 35cm diameter without eccentric hub.
Replacement wheel 35cm diameter with eccentric hub In those cases where it is technically or aesthetically not possible to come to a satisfactory result with a seperate eccentric hub, EZ Power Steering makes steering wheels with an eccentric center, thereby achieving the same effect.
The steering wheel layout is slightly adjusted to hide the eccentric effect. In case of the Corvette C1 steering wheel in the drawing the bottom vertical spoke is slightly shorter than the two horizontal spokes. In the humble beginning was the C1 Corvette. To save money GM used off-the-shelf mechanical components and used the chassis and suspension from existing passenger cars. The car had a uniquely masculine, muscular, almost predatory look.
In the days that followed the Motorama, the Chevrolet Corvette— the first true American sports car — was born. Below, we have all the Corvette C1 specs, from performance numbers to recall information, options, colors and pricing. All the C1 Corvette specs are broken out by year model.
The C2 Corvette was known as the Sting Ray. With an innovative new chassis designers were able to push the limits for the basic look of the Sting Ray. The C2 Corvette Sting Ray not only had a new design, but also newfound handling prowess thanks to lighter weight.

It sounds like at your height, almost any car will be not as comfortable as sitting in your recliner in front of the TV. I know several 6'4'' guys that have no issues, they just learn to live with it as if they were in any other car. The Corvette is made for "average" people, but your pushing the envelope in that area.
Your knees is what would be the concern here, do they rest on the underside of the dash? If so, I'vd venture to guess a long road trip may not be as comfortable as being in a Lincoln town car. Go rent one, take it on a long weekend drive to enjoy it. If you do enjoy it, place your order. If you don't cry a little and look around. Teonte answered 7 years ago.
Actually, on long road trips, my butt gets cramps from my legs setting higher because the seats are low, as is the car.
People don't realize the Corvette is so low until after a lengthy drive, they try to get out. I'm only 6' and have the seat all the way back. I only have issues with reaching the radio or shifting the stick shift without leaning to the right. I drive the old style, with my arms extended out, that's why the seat is back.
The cockpit is cramped even for us "shorter" people, but the seat backs are comfortable on the longer rides. The only advantage to being 6'4" or above, is you know before I do when it starts to rain.
Think it is more about your build than height I'm 6'2" and a big guy I wouldn't take it cross contry, but as a daily driver or even a short drive up the coast, it is fine AmerFlyer answered 6 years ago.
Legroom is most important to me. Guess I'll need to go sit in one to be certain. John answered 6 years ago. Ever fly SouthWest airlines? The Corvette seats are wider and leg room is longer.
Only if your passenger can bring you a mixed drink will it be similar. No it is not a Cadillac or a Lincoln Town-car, but like everything else, once you get used to it, your complaints will go away.
You will remember the thrill of the drive, the joy of having others look at your ride, and it really is comfortable. In our Corvette Club we have had very tall people drive around in the Corvette, even the C-3s. They worked out just fine. Like a horse, once in the saddle, it's a great ride. The best thing for you to do, is to bring a can of lube with you and grease yourself up before getting into the corvette.
This can also help you when trying to get out of it too. If the fit is too tight, at least you'll still have the lube with you to entice the sales girl or secretary with. Possibly, she has the keys to the back seat of a new Chevy Tahoe on the lot, where you can get some action. John answered 5 years ago. The newer Corvettes addressed the growing population. Get in one and drive it.
If you want, rent one for the weekend and go on a long drive. I have a tall trunk and med. Try it you'll like it. BobBlueC5 answered 5 years ago.
I have a C5 and my knees are 4" from the dash. I drove it from Virginia to FL in one day.
