In windows 7 my printer, an HP CP, worked automatically without needing to install any drivers - as they are included in the OS.
However, when i go to print in windows 8, i cannot. The drivers do not exist for windows 8. The forums suggest i install the windows 7 drivers. However, when i go to the HP website to download the Windows 7 drivers, I cannot, because as the HP website correctly states, they are included in the OS and do not need to be downloaded.
So what do I do now? I cannot print or scan my HP Scanjet has exactly the same problem. PS it also turned my trackpad upside down - so now when i scroll - it goes the wrong way. Did it ask whether i wanted this? Am i able to turn it back? This thread is locked. You can follow the question or vote as helpful, but you cannot reply to this thread.

If the cable is undamaged and shorter than 3 m 9 ft 10 in , connect the cable to a different USB port on the computer. The port should be USB 2. If you are using a USB hub or docking station, connect the cable directly to the computer. Turn on the printer, and then add the printer Mac or wait for the computer to install the new device Windows.
Make sure you are using an undamaged Ethernet cable, check for a green light near the Ethernet port on the printer, and then print a report to verify the connection. Turn off the printer, and then disconnect the Ethernet cable from the router and the printer. Check the cable for damage, and then verify that it is an Ethernet cable and not a phone cable. Ethernet and phone cables look similar, but Ethernet cables are usually bigger and have eight visible wires on the connector.
Reconnect the cable to a different Ethernet or LAN port on the router, and then connect the other end to the printer's Ethernet port. Check the lights on the printer's Ethernet port to make sure the connection is successful. The green light should be steady, and the orange activity light should blink.
