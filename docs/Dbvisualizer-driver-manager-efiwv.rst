Anastasiia Sergienko, Software Developer at Exasol. I am developing and testing out database, schema creation, data migrations and general SQL query and reporting.
This tool was very easy to install and get using right away. It is very flexible in writing and running code and portions of code. The wizards is extremely easy to setup new connections right the first time. One can "sling" data between databases of varying types with ease, even LARGE data sets, if necessary.
It's not an ETL tool. I am a product integration developer in a database company. I use DbVisualizer as a default SQL client on my daily work for performing compatibility tests between databases and testing our integration extensions. I like its user-friendly interface and rich feature set. The feature that it saves settings between the sessions is the most I like.
If you interact with databases, use DbVisualizer! It will make your daily work easier. Muhammet Orazov, Software Engineer at Exasol. Since I teach and use 3 database engines, it is the perfect tool to switch among them.
It is reliable and I trust in its results. DbVisualizer's features, functions and GUI have been optimized for more than a decade with continuous feedback from thousands of professional users. Since DbVisualizer connects to all your different databases and runs on all your OSes, you only have to learn one tool. This increases productivity and knowledge sharing.
