Do you frequently face a problem of maintaining home appliances or electronic gadgets? A quick look at the reflection off the baseplate surface shows it has a slightly convex shape with a center pinpoint marking the apex.
Faint circular machine marks are visible with a prominent line about halfway from the edge. The most critical aspect of installation is firm, maximum contact between the base and the CPU heatspreader for efficient heat conduction.
Ideally it should also be a simple procedure with the user having to handle as few pieces of hardware as possible. A plastic backplate is utilized, perhaps because the base of the cooler is not very heavy. Double-sided standoffs are used to secure the backplate to the motherboard and thumbnuts pin down the mounting frame. Fans are mounted using long bolts and washers, and short screws keep the radiator in place.
Before installing, it would be prudent to quickly check the mounting hardware. Our sample included a thumbnut that was only partially threaded, preventing it from properly mating with the standoffs.
Backplate and standoffs installed. Fully mounted and plugged in. Obviously the lighting is more impressive in a dark environment. We mount our CPU coolers on a Puget Systems Test Bench but as it lacks as a dual 14 cm fan mount, we placed the radiator on the X61 box with a bed of foam along the top side of the motherboard to simulate its typical position inside a case.
Before thermal testing, we took some basic physical measurements of the radiator for comparison. Testing on larger heatsinks like this one is done on our LGA heatsink testing platform. A summary of the test system and procedure follows. Normally, our reference fans are used whenever possible, the measured details of which are shown below.
Load testing was accomplished using Prime95 to stress the processor, and the graph function in SpeedFan was used to ensure that the load temperature is stable for at least ten minutes. The temperature recorded is the highest single core reading. The stock fans were tested at various voltages to represent a good cross-section of airflow and noise performance.
There are many similar closed-loop all-in-one water coolers on the market. Main interface advanced. Our X61 sample was much better in this regard — the reported fan speed was steady and accurate though not the pump speed , and the control slider adjusted both the fan and pump speeds in unison.
A cursory check found identical performance whether the pump was running at maximum or minimum speed. Used for ubuntu airlive wtpci driver installation and a well-known IP.
