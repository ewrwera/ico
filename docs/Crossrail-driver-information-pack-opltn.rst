The upgrading of Bank and Waterloo stations for other services must have their own positive effects. It will act as a link line to all those suburban services going out of Waterloo.
Perhaps an escalator connection between the suburban platforms at Waterloo and the Drain should be provided. There are various improvements happening at Waterloo station. Whilst Waterloo is not a Crossrail 2 station, a fair proportion of its services via Wimbledon are planned to be transferred to the new line. How will all the Waterloo developments affect this? Waterloo station is well connected to the North,South and East, in the opposite directions to the lines to Vauxhall, Clapham Junction stations and all points South-West.
The current plan requires Wimbledon station to be seriously rebuilt and this is causing problems with the natives, which I can understand. In the plan, twenty tph will come together at Raynes Park or Wimbledon stations and take the tunnel to the North.
As an example of my thinking, I believe that new faster Class trains or something similar could double the frequency from 2 tph to the Crossrail 2 frequency of 4 tph on the suburban services out of Waterloo via Wimbledon.
But surely, the biggest factor is that Waterloo to Wimbledon local services would have at least double the capacity. I am drawn to thinking that we could have a high-capacity link along generally the route of Crossrail 2, that could be upgraded in the future as circumstances dictate that more capacity is needed. The existing West Anglia Main Line is congested and it needs to be four-tracked from Coppermill Junction to Broxbourne for several reasons. If the lines out of Waterloo were upgraded, as I mentioned in the previously, there would then be the problem of creating the middle section of a Virtual Crossrail 2.
If an extension to Liverpool Street station were to be built as I indicated earlier to the North of the main line station beside Shoreditch High Street station, there could be at least three routes. The big problem is that those living close to the intermediate stations Like me!
This would need a tunnel to be bored from Tottenham Hale to Wimbledon, which could be delayed until it is really needed and the money can be raised. Consider the services to the possible Southern termini, if lines through Clapham Junction were to be upgraded with ATO.
If extra services are needed at Wimbledon or Balham, the capacity could be on the existing lines signalled under ATO, which could certainly handle 24 tph. So would it be logical to not pass through Tooting Broadway station, but use it as the Southern terminal? The tunnel is probably too long to be single-track with single-platform stations, like the Loop under Liverpool on the Wirral Line.
But fast trains and good design of track and stations, might just make an affordable Crossrail 2 serving both Balham and Tooting Broadway. But I have seen some crazy ideas work on my travels around the railways of Europe and we must not put limits on what we think is possible.
I shall be surprised if Crossrail 2 is built before , as various projects and ATO will create enough capacity to push the line futher into the future. Thank you for this comprehensive post, it puts many of suggested and planned improvements into overall perspective. Moreover, thank you for you posts over the years, I read almost all of them. I hope you have a good holidays and Happy New Year. Comment by rapidtransitman December 28, Reply. Comment by AnonW December 28, Reply. Bishopsgate was the terminus.
Liverpool Street is a later extension. A couple of the platforms are still there — Bishopsgate Low Level. New terminating platforms alongside the Braithwaite viaduct using a restored Eastern Counties entrance would be an elegant lower level to a redevelpment over the Shoreditch box station.
