The driver installed without a problem and the test page prints just fine from Windows 7. Thanks for the lead. Worked for me too. But HP still needs to create the appropriate drivers.
The Test Page printed just fine. But nothing else prints correctly. I get the following error message printed:. So the quest to print continues. If this is not fixed properly, my next printer won't be an HP. I used to be brand loyal to Lexmark, then they screwed up once too often.
I consider this to be a major issue. HP should support recently manufactured printers. Didn't find what you were looking for?
