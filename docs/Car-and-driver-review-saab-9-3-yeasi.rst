But it is competent and buttoned down in a way the current car is not. Gone is the tippy feeling that makes the current feel as if its center of gravity were a foot above the roof. But it was a progressive sort of push, and the car remains stable even over midcorner bumps. Helping in this regard is a new four-link independent rear suspension. The rear system incorporates passive rear steer, which slightly changes the toe of the rear tires to aid in turning.
Saab also makes extensive use of aluminum to reduce unsprung weight. The front suspension is also a great improvement. Still a strut setup, this new suspension is mounted to a stiff, hydroformed subframe with bushings that are extremely soft in longitudinal motion to improve ride quality.
The same bushings are very stiff laterally, which brings a level of accuracy to the steering, not a strong point in the current car. Saab also mounted the steering rack lower in the structure to reduce some of the well-known torque steer. We had to floor the gas pedal in low gears to get even a hint of torque steer. All the cars we sampled on this early drive had base-level hp, 2. This is the only engine that will be available when this goes on sale here in October. Then, early in , a higher-boost, hp version of this engine will arrive in Arc and Vector models read "luxury" and "sport".
Both engines are versions of GM's Ecotec all-aluminum, twin-cam four-cylinder. The base-level Linear model comes with the lower-boost engine. Although horsepower doesn't sound like much it's 30 horses less than last year's base engine , it is within 10 of other European competitors' base engines and feels more than adequate for day-to-day driving.
And with pound-feet of torque at rpm, the Saab motor produces more torque than competitors' base engines. The high-boost engine makes pound-feet of torque. The manual transmission is a modified version of the current five-speed. But where the current unit feels uncertain and clunky, this new shifter slots decisively into its gates. A simpler but still Saab-like dashboard debuted last year, but otherwise, it's business as usual.
The steering still feels overly light most of the time, more road noise can be heard here than in most competitors, the manual's shifter still feels as if it were attached to the transmission with ropes, and the seats are still swathed in expensive-looking leather and remain comfortable and supportive. The five extra horses put out by the front-driver's now hp, 2. Despite the 's go-its-own-way personality, the Swedish manufacturer isn't immune to the desires of the market. Most of the 's competitors, for example, offer all-wheel drive, so after sufficient harping from Saab's U.
The all-wheel-drive system sends power to the rear wheels via an electronic clutch pack, where a computer-controlled limited-slip differential can lock the rear differential as needed to aid handling, stability, or traction. A brief drive in prototypes with the new XWD "cross-wheel drive" system we weren't allowed to turn off the stability control showed that the all-wheel-drive car is willing to hang out its tail under power until the stability control steps in, and of course it has more traction for accelerating in slippery conditions.
We couldn't really detect the extra power of the hp version, perhaps due to the all-wheel drive's additional weight. Still, the increased traction leads us to suspect that XWD models will prove more popular than the front-drivers over time.
Ample thrust is available at all speeds, so passing maneuvers can be accomplished without shifting. This is a good thing, because the six-speed manual box feels notchy, particularly when shifting from first to second or fifth to sixth. The automatic seems well matched to the engine and offers a fully manual mode with steering-wheel shifting. Tweaks were made to the suspension bushings and springs, primarily to account for the V-6's pounds of extra weight.
Tighter steering and larger anti-roll bars improve the new Aero's road manners and general responsiveness while retaining a supple ride quality. It won't pass for a BMW we've never driven a front-drive car that could , but we expect the new Aero to stand tall against other high-performing front-drivers.
