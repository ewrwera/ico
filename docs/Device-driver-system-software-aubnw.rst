Privacy policy. It is challenging to give a single precise definition for the term driver. In the most fundamental sense, a driver is a software component that lets the operating system and a device communicate with each other.
For example, suppose an application needs to read some data from a device. The application calls a function implemented by the operating system, and the operating system calls a function implemented by the driver. The driver, which was written by the same company that designed and manufactured the device, knows how to communicate with the device hardware to get the data. After the driver gets the data from the device, it returns the data to the operating system, which returns it to the application.
In many cases, a device is designed according to a published hardware standard. This means that the driver can be written by Microsoft, and the device designer does not have to provide a driver. The conventional way to visualize the stack is with the first participant at the top and the last participant at the bottom, as shown in this diagram. Some of the drivers in the stack might participate by transforming the request from one format to another.
These drivers do not communicate directly with the device; they just manipulate the request and pass the request along to drivers that are lower in the stack. Function driver : The one driver in the stack that communicates directly with the device is called the function driver.
Filter driver : The drivers that perform auxiliary processing are called filter drivers. For more information on stacks, see Driver stacks.
We could expand our definition of driver by saying that a driver is any software component that observes or participates in the communication between the operating system and a device.
