The caption said the car had nine teens it in when it hit a pole. We all stood around, examining the picture, trying to identify various body parts that protruded from the remains of the car.

Unfortunately that afternoon after a hardly touched lunch, the entire graduating class was to attend a special blessing church service at the Pentacostal Holiness Church just down the street. I can still remember our class sitting in the rear pews and the first hymn being something like "There's Power in the Blood".
A few of us needed a little air and quietly filed out before all four verses were sung Finally came "Bathed in a Fountain of Blood" and that did it! The rest of us staggered out to call it a day. There was enough green among that class that we could have passed for invasion troops.
Noah 8-? I still found it bothersome. I think a couple of other posters here are right; some kids who are "too cool for school" would joke and sneer at it. Maybe it's time for a new "Signal 30" with footage of teenagers involved in fatal MVAs. Reviewer: Bob63 - favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite - June 5, Subject: Signal Indelible Memories This film is one that was shown to my Driver's Ed class, and I not only remember it, I've told several people about it, including my children.
I graduated in from Ontario, only a few miles from where the opening sequences were shot. We were told by our Driver's Ed teacher that the term "Signal 30" came from the fact that the majority of the accidents filmed occurred on US 30, which was a main east-west highway prior to the construction of the Interstate Highway system.
I got a big kick out of seeing grown men turn green! I've only watched the streaming version so far; considering the age and makeup of my system it would probably be unfair to comment on the quality. It was good enough to really remind me of the class, though. If you have children who are getting their license, or just got them, I highly recommend showing them this film and its sequel, particularly as most Driver's Ed programs don't show it due to its graphic nature.
Reviewer: reactorbear - favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite - November 9, Subject: A must see for all young drivers This was shown when I was in 8th grade many moons ago and it has left a permanent impact.
It probably would not be allowed to be shown in schools today due to its graphical nature. I am sure some of the parents who complain would be ones that let their children see slasher movies and watch CSI. Too bad. The film was not meant to shock as much as show there is a consequence and possibly a gruesome and deadly consequence for one's action. Often not a popular concept in today's society. If it were shown in today's classroom, students would sneer and laugh trying to show they are more cool and more sophisticated of which they are neither than the audiences who watched it Other than the age of the cars, nothing keeps the film from being as powerful today as it was nearly fifty years ago when it was produced.
Despite improved safety features on modern cars, we still have thousands literally of individuals who never return home from a car trip. The main theme, as the narrator often brings up, is there is a cost for acting stupid. As far as a fatal car accident, everyone thinks it can't happen to them. I bet the individuals in this movie who lost their lives thought the same thing. Reviewer: anakin - favorite favorite favorite favorite - July 6, Subject: As pertinent Today as Ever Every young person should see this film, though today's teens think they are too jaded for this "back in the day" fare.
They are wrong-the same careless, reckless attitude can make them an unwilling star in their own graphic film. I saw this film back in junior high, and it was the first uncensored look at the aftermath of vehicle accidents I and most of my classmates had seen. It was disturbing, to say the least.

Following an incdent in which his parked car was hit by a drunk driver, Neyhart began advocating for safety, and landed on the revolutionary idea that instilling safe driving habits in kids would make them better drivers for life, and thus decrease accidents on the road. Neyhart began teaching driver's ed at State College High School in the mids, and authored the first textbook, The Safe Operation of an Automobile, in  Neyhart's instruction used his own Graham-Paige that's a car for demonstration and test driving, but getting kids on the road one at a time was inefficient given the number of students.
In the early '50s, only about one percent of them were getting on-road instruction; to solve the problem, insurance company Aetna invented the Aetna Drivotrainer which was introduced in Brooklyn in  Students sat in this boxy simulator, watched an instructional film projected in front of them, and attempted to move the wheel, pedals and gear shift as necessary.
Instruments recorded their performance, and issued a printout assessing their abilities. The driving simulators became and still are a central feature of many driver's education classes, though later generations got to use something slightly cooler than the Drivotrainer. Simulators of the '60s and '70s were designed by automobile manufacturers and approximated the look and feel of actual production models -- so that teens could claim to have learned on, say, a Dodge Dart.
It didn't have wheels or a roof or a real engine, but it had a real Dodge Dart seat, steering wheel, and dashboard. If the vintage driver's ed simulators were odd-looking, the instructional films -- known as "scare films" -- were simply terrifying. They started out as cautionary tales about lives ruined, but drifted in more of a cinema verite direction, prioritizing discomforting visuals over real instructional information. Dick York in Last Date Source: imdb. In the film, he plays a character who goes joyriding with his girlfriend, Jeanne.
Last Date was one of the more well-known films sponsored by Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company and its parent company, Kemper Insurance. The film won multiple awards and was named best nontheatrical picture on the prevention of traffic accidents by the National Committee on Films for Safety in  It also coined the term "teenicide" as "the fine art of killing yourself, and maybe someone else, with an automobile before you reach the age of twenty.
And Then There Were Four tells the story of five drivers. It is made clear early in the film that only four of those drivers will survive and viewers must watch in suspense to discover who will not make it. Much of the film is concentrated on the discussion of reckless driving habits.
The film was originally shown in theatres before being released on the nontheatrical circuit.
