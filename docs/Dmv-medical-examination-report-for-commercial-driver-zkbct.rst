Uncontrollable malignant very dangerous hypertension that is rapidly progressive is disqualifying. Musculo-skeletal system They have no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of rheumatic, arthritic, orthopedic, muscular, neuromuscular, or vascular disease that interferes with their ability to control and operate a motor vehicle safely.

Clinical diagnosis of epilepsy is a key medical factor for determining whether an individual is qualified to obtain a commercial license. A clinical diagnosis of epilepsy will usually require a controlling anti-convulsant medication and the driver will not qualify for interstate driving.
Blackouts of known cause, when the cause is no longer present nor likely to recur, may not be disqualifying such as a lapse of consciousness due to pregnancy, high fever, allergic reaction to prescribed medication, or insect bite. The physician should withhold certification until the driver has fully recovered from the condition. Mental or functional disorder They have no mental, nervous, organic, or functional disease or psychiatric disorder likely to interfere with their ability to drive a motor vehicle safely.
Physical disorders often underlie these problems. A variety of functional disorders can cause drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, weakness, or paralysis that may lead to poor coordination, inattention, loss of control, and susceptibility to accidents while driving.
Physical fatigue, headache, impaired coordination, recurring physical ailments, and chronic pain may be present to such a degree that certification for commercial driving is inadvisable. Medications taken to relieve these disorders, such as pain relievers, tranquilizers, and mood elevators, may produce side effects which would also preclude commercial licensing.

If the driver meets the criteria by using a hearing aid, the driver must wear the hearing aid and have it in operation at all times while driving, and have a spare power source for the hearing aid in possession. Drugs They do not use an amphetamine, narcotic, or any habit-forming drug. The driver does not have to be addicted or a habitual user to be found unqualified.
