Practice how to turn the vehicle left and right while backing up. Making turns Large, open parking lots are great for practicing turning. Learn how to steer throughout the turn, and practice right turns first. Right turns Check traffic to the left, right, front, and rear.
Slow down and signal at least feet more than half a city block before turning. Practice doing right turns, as wide turns can be dangerous with oncoming traffic. Left turns Left turns are much easier to make. Once again, check traffic, slow down and signal, and keep your eyes on the lane you are turning into. Intersections Intersections can be intimidating, but we have a step-by-step guide to help make learning easier. Lane choices It is important to choose your lanes wisely.
Choose a lane that is appropriate for the driving maneuver you are doing, such as turning or parking. Choose a lane that is the least congested, unless you are turning or stopping. If a roadway has two lanes moving in the same direction, select the right lane. If you can choose among three lanes, choose the middle lane. To pass or turn left, use the left lane. Lane changes It takes practice to be able to change lanes smoothly. Make sure you check traffic, glance in your mirrors, check your blind spot, and signal before changing lanes.
The more space you allow between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead, the more time you will have to see a hazard or collision down the road and respond accordingly.

Look in all directions for traffic before turning and while making the turn. Traffic can appear within seconds, so stay alert. Freeway Driving Freeway driving is a lot faster than driving in a residential area.
Choose long on-ramps and off-ramps to practice entering and exiting the freeway. Use the three-second rule for following distance and adjust your lane position as needed for traffic conditions.
Driving at night It is best not to start driving at night until you have mastered all your driving skills during daylight hours. At night, make sure you have your headlights on at all times—this way, other drivers can see you coming, and you have a better view of the road.
