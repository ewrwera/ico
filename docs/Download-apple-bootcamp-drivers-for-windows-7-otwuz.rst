For example, many MacPro users use BC5. The BC5. If apple is worried about users installing the wrong drivers, I'd respond from the world of Windows by saying "we call that Tuesday". Well actually installers are pretty good at detecting devices and doing things right nowadays without the help of using a model identifier, but I get it. Apple's going to limit the options for users to mess things up.
I rebooted into windows, and when I run "Setup" I only get the option to "repair" my existing Boot Camp installation. Surely a typo. So I can't really find any documentation about what the latest version of the software is but I heard they've only incremented to 6. When I poke around on the BCA stick, the drivers are dated  On the internet I've seen news about 6. I'd say it's probable that the files on my memory stick are from 6. BTW I'm on a mid 13" macbook pro.
At this point I'd like to blame the BCA procedure, but it looks like the Boot Camp Installer isn't programmed to check if the existing installation is old. Some version history note on Wikipedia says "only support new installation.
It looks like I'm going to have to find some hack to get the new drivers to install, or risk uninstalling everything I currently have for boot camp so I can get the installer to install, and cross my fingers that I can run my system in-between boot camp installations.
