Pros: this exceeds my expectations for what I needed of a printer it does both sides printing it does booklet printing and all you have to do is fold and staple they come out in proper order scans are fairly quick and high resolution available for pictures so that billfold can be made screen size no problems plenty of paper capacity for in feed good envelope handling very happy with this that I received as a Christmas gift.
Pros: Prints fast!!! This is my first laser printer, I wanted one for a long time and finally decided to spring for one. I have had it for about 6 months now and I print 2 to 12 pages a day is all but I am still using the original one. Cons: The printer worked fine with a 3' USB cable but the scanner would not work with a longer cable hooked to it.
Took me a while to figure what was wrong, it turned out I had to use a repeater cable to get it to work. No where in the instructions or the website did they mention this. I searched around online and finally found others that had the same problem and solved it with the repeater cable. Pros: Simple setup, works flawlessly, toner life seems good, multifunction although I do not use it for FAXing.
Other Thoughts: Had two different HP printers before this one. The PhotoSmart had horrible ink life, wouldn't print envelopes and eventually quit after about two years. The second was internet capable, but never worked at all and I returned it. The Canon has had no problems so far. Pros: This is an all around quality product sufficient for home use, home office use, or even small business use. There was a thread somewhere about canon's policy.
