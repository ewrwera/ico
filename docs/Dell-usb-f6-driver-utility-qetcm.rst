During a reinstallation of Windows with an active RAID array, the OS may prompt for a storage controller driver which must be installed before the software may be loaded. Download the correct Pre-OS driver from our support site and have it extracted. The driver to download is different for the two versions of IRST. Be sure to get the correct driver, often designated the F6 driver.
The IRSTe driver is not however. This will have to be completed on an alternate system. Once the files are extracted, proceed with the installation of Windows as normal. The USB with drivers will also need to be plugged into the system in order to install the drivers. On the left hand side of the screen, select the option to load driver.

Get drivers and downloads for your Dell PowerEdge  Download and install the latest drivers, firmware and software. The server also lacked an internal floppy drive, and there was no available slot to add one. This is a common problem, especially with newer RAID controllers. I rebooted the server with the drive into plugged into a USB port on the back of the server, but had the same result.
Next I tried copying the drivers to my USB flash drive, which I tried in the ports on both the front and the back of the server, and the installation program failed to see that drive as well. I searched support. This sounded like exactly what I needed. I downloaded the USB utility, and when I executed it I was informed this program would format my flash drive, which would obviously delete everything I had saved to it.
It took about three seconds to run, and I went back to my server and ran the Windows setup again — and once again the installer did not recognize my flash drive. I tried to view the contents of the flash drive on a Windows XP computer, but I was informed the flash drive was not formatted.
