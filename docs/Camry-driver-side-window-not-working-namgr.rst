The Scion xD and Corolla does too. Are your windows not working on your Toyota Camry? Here is a guide on how to fix it. In order to properly fix the problem, it is important to properly diagnose it.
Take some time to really consider what is going on and if you understand the full extent of the problem. Misdiagnosing a problem can lead to additional repair time and money wasted.
When you know what the problem is, here are some likely fixes. The Toyota Camry windows are a pretty straightforward system. There are tracks on each side of the window that are attached to the door to keep the window in place. If your window slips or falls, look at these tracks to see if any of them are loose. Over time, the window tracks can get worn down. You can order new tracks or you can use glue or new screws into the door panel to keep the track in place.
Another culprit for the window not staying up is a bad fuse. Toyota put a 30A fuse in the fuse box that controls the power windows, power locks, and power moonroof. Keep in mind, the fuse controls all three systems. If it is just the windows, you probably have a bad regulator. The power windows are operated by a motor attached to a lever system also known as the window regulator. This pushes the window up and manages the speed it retracts. They are exposed to the elements every time that you open the door.
They function very simply. There is a 12 volt signal at the switch. It sends that signal to the power window motor. A lot of them are riveted in, so be prepared to deal with that. The motor going bad is almost always a slow process. The window guide is what guides a window through the door as it goes back up. If it goes bad, then the window can stick. If there is anything that you would like to add, please leave a comment below.
Good luck!
