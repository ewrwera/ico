However, there are also several other unique rules and recommendations for driving in Australia. In Australia, separate motoring groups operate roadside assistance programs in each of the territories and states of the country. In order to access these services in the event of a breakdown, though, you'll have to purchase an annual membership to the motoring group of your choice. Fortunately, each group has reciprocal arrangements with the others, so you'll only need to purchase one to enjoy the benefits across the country.
While most rental companies do not allow their vehicles to be taken on unsealed gravel roads found in the Outback, but if you purchase a vehicle for a longer trip or rent from specific agencies, you may be able to enjoy a unique outing in the remote regions of Australia during your trip. However, it's important to prepare for your journey by fueling up and potentially bringing extra fuel before you set out into the desert. Additionally, since temperatures can reach up to 45 degrees Celsius degrees Fahrenheit in the daytime, you'll need to bring plenty of water to stay hydrated and make sure your vehicle is able to withstand extreme heat.
Don't expect your cell phone to work when traveling in the Outback since cell phone tours are only found around rural towns and urban populations. If you plan to spend significant time exploring the region, though, you may want to purchase or rent a satellite phone, which can typically get reception anywhere in the world.
Depending on the length of your stay, buying a car and reselling it at the end of your trip may be more cost-effective than renting one. Fortunately, there are a number of agencies in major cities across the country that specialize in selling to foreign drivers. Ideally, you should rent a car if you're driving in the country for less than three weeks, you should buy if you're staying for more than three months, and you can do either one if you're visiting between three weeks and three months.
Australia is home to a number of large wildlife including emus, camels, horses, cattle, and kangaroos, which often wander onto the roads across the country—especially in rural areas and most of the Outback.
As a result, scan the sides of the road while driving and use caution when traveling through dense brush and rural areas. Also be ready to use your brakes and try to avoid swerving to miss these critters, which could cause an even bigger accident if you lose control of the vehicle.
Curfews are in effect for driving after sunset in Western Australia and the Northern Territory to avoid serious injury from collisions with large animals. If you have to travel at night, reduce your driving speed and turn on your high beams if not facing oncoming traffic.
If you do hit an animal, stop if it is safe to do so and phone the appropriate trained wildlife rescue group, which vary by state. Try to remove any injured or deceased animal to the side of the road if it is safe to do so, then call the appropriate rescue group.
If you're planning on driving to the coastal capital of Victoria, Melbourne, you'll need to be aware of the extensive network of streetcars that run across the city. Drivers are sometimes permitted to drive on the tram tracks the crisscross Melbourne, which is denoted by dotted yellow lines; however, you are not permitted to make a turn from the tram track or drive on one if there is a solid yellow line beside it. To make a right turn from the left-hand side of the road where Australians drive if there is a tram track present at the intersection, you will need to make what is known as a hook turn.
In order to do so, signal a right-hand turn, pull into the intersection as far left as you can without entering the pedestrian crosswalk, then turn right when the light for the perpendicular roadway you're turning right onto changes to green. A sign will be posted if a hook turn is required at the intersection, but if you do not see one of these signs, do not make a hook turn and simply turn right from the rightmost lane.
A driver licence is required in Australia before a person is permitted to drive a motor vehicle of any description on a road in Australia. The responsibility for the regulation and enforcement of road use, including light vehicle driver licensing is the responsibility of the state and territory governments.
In , a national drivers licence scheme was agreed by the states to provide uniform arrangements for the post-novice licensing of drivers of motor vehicles, the renewal of licences, and their suspension and cancellation, and to facilitate the mutual recognition between Australian jurisdictions of driver licences when transferring between jurisdictions.
The national ID database would be used to monitor public events, but could be transferred to a national drivers licence system with agreement from the states. The medical standards for drivers of commercial vehicles are set by the National Transport Commission and Austroads. The driver of a vehicle carrying paying passengers such as a school bus or tourist coach is required to hold a driver licence depending on the size of the vehicle as well as a 'Public Passenger Vehicle Driver Authority' which is issued by the state or territory Ministry of Transport.
The official nomenclature for car licences varies in the states and territories, for example, 'Driver's Licence' or 'Driver Licence'. However, 'Driver's Licence' is most commonly used.
The official names for learners also vary, for example, 'Learner Driver Licences' or 'Learner's Permit'. The minimum driving age for drivers varies between states and territories. Learner drivers may drive, under the supervision of a fully licensed driver, from 15 years and 9 months in the ACT, [5] and 16 years in the other states and the Northern Territory. The minimum unsupervised driving age is 18 years in Victoria, 16 years and 6 months in the Northern Territory, and 17 years in all other states and the ACT.
After obtaining a licence, drivers continue to be subject to restrictions during a probationary period, which is two years in the Northern Territory and Western Australia, three years in the ACT, New South Wales and South Australia, and four years in Victoria. The driving age in the ACT is 17 years, but after obtaining a licence, a driver is subject to restrictions during a three-year probationary period. The Road Ready course at a Road Ready Centre is a minimum of ten hours, during which an applicant learns the road rules, undergoes alcohol education and hazard perception training.
Alternatively, a provisional licence may be obtained by recording driving experience in the same logbook, with a supervisor who has held an open licence for 12 months for the class of vehicle used. The difference in using this method to obtain a provisional licence is that the logbook only records time spent driving, and not the learner's ability to drive.
While no minimum number of hours are required, Learners are advised when obtaining their Learner's Licence, that 50 or more practical hours are recommended before attempting the practical test. Using this method, provided the driver has held their Learner's licence for at least 6 months, they may book with RTA for the practical driving test.
If the driver has obtained a licence in an automatic transmission vehicle, an 'A' is placed on the licence which restricts the licence holder to driving automatic transmission vehicles for 12 months. To remove the restriction before 12 months, the provisional driver must pass the practical driving exam in a manual transmission vehicle. A Provisional Licence is valid for three years. A 'PC' condition is displayed on the licence, which indicates that the provisional driver can drive with 'P plates not displayed'.
The minimum driving age in New South Wales is 16 years. The learner licence may be obtained at age  After holding the learner licence for six months a provisional licence may be obtained. Once the provisional licence is obtained, it must be held for a minimum of 2 years before obtaining the full northern territory licence.
Provisional drivers need to comply with all road rules and traffic laws and other restrictions: eg. Accumulating five or more demerit points within a month period will trigger action against a provisional driver.
To get a Provisional Licence also called a probationary licence and commonly referred to as Ps , you must have held a learner's permit for at least 12 months, be at least 17 years of age or have an equivalent interstate or overseas driver's licence and be at least  If you had a learner's permit, you must also have a log book showing you have had at least 75 hours driving experience including at least 15 hours of night-time driving which must have all been signed by the Qualified Supervising Driver.
