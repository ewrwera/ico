It will simulate driving during different times of day and during various weather conditions, for example, giving tips like better scanning through visual and verbal instruction. On a modern driver simulator, there are up to different scenarios simulated that teach the range of cognitive skills needed to deal with complex roadway and traffic conditions, including situation awareness, hazard perception, decision making under time pressure, and general defensive driving techniques, according to Mochel.
The stats are hard to ignore. In Gwinnett County, one of the most populated counties in Georgia, teen fatalities in cars have fallen from 23 in to only five in , according to research by Atlanta-based Kennesaw State University.
Research in other parts of the country reflects similar findings. In January , a researcher at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of car crashes among local high school students who had taken part in virtual simulation.
His research found that the group of students who incorporated simulator training had significantly less driving infractions and no car crashes over both time periods, while more than one-quarter of the control group experienced car crashes after one year. He notes that throughout his undergrad career and even in his current job he has been exposed to simulation as a form of training to fly a plane, drive a ship, and coordinate shooting of missiles, cannons, and artillery.
He says that repeated flight training through simulation gave him the "creative reserve" to think outside of the box. It allowed him to land on the water when no other option was possible at the time. Pilots are required to practice simulator training every months to prepare for rain, snow, ice, fog, wind, and other types of inclement weather, along with emergencies like engine and hydraulic failures. But when it comes to driving, simulation has not entered the mainstream of driving education, even though traffic crashes are the number one killer of teens in America with around 3, deaths per year, according to the CDC.
To put the numbers in perspective, around 4, American soldiers were killed in the Iraq War between and , according to iCasualties. Virtual Driving Essentials. Advanced Driver Safety.

Benefits of using a SimuRide driving simulator instead of learning the driving process with a car:. Driving lessons become a lot safer. Thus, resulting in fewer on road accidents, less stress for parents, instructors, and other drivers that share the road.
Crossing busy intersections with traffic lights, yield or stop signs teaches students to make the right decision. One winding road throws boulders across the path of the driver at random.
Here, the student learns defensive driving and how to react quickly and appropriately by braking, accelerating, or changing lanes in time.
