Able to organically create the tone of a tube amp at the point of breakup, the Tube Driver has been loved by guitarists since its inception decades ago for that all-natural tone and feel.
A favorite among blues players, this pedal is at home anywhere the warmth and presence of overdriven tubes is needed. Want to Sell Yours? Anyone can sell on Reverb.

The first version of the Mini Boogee in the cast metal enclosure.
The third version of the Mini Boogee in the folded metal enclosure with imitation wood end caps. An early incarnation of the 5 knob Tube Driver, with two preamp tubes. No op-amps.
The layout and graphics were designed to make it look like a mini amplifier, even including a bright switch. The power transformer was built internally, as on later Tube Driver models. There were several versions of the enclosure:. Slight changes to the circuit and pcb layout were made throughout production. Randall Smith of Mesa Engineering sent a cease and desist to Butler in demanding he stop using the name Boogee, since that was too close to the name Smith was using for his Boogie amps.
Butler changed the name to Mini Matrix, creating a third version of the black enclosure. It was sold until  Both sides of pcb are a tan colored. Resistors are soldered on the back side, capacitors and other components on the front. A circuit board made for Butler by a California firm.
Traceack side was usually dark green, with no ID labeling. Most components were soldered on the front, but a few caps and resistors were soldered on the back. I have never seen one dated earlier than , but Butler said he first designed this version in  Butler insists that there never was a "Chandler" Tube Driver, that they just handled the marketing and distribution, but since the first version was ONLY branded with the Chandler name, and the revised graphics had Chandler's name under Butler's, the nickname is understandable.
Some of these early Tube Drivers were offered with a mid range knob or tube bias knob as a custom option. The bias pot allowed the gain of the tube to be altered by adjusting the voltage on the cathodes of the tube, simulating the effect of using higher or lower gain tubes. There were several different versions of the circuit, each with minor differences. The Level, Hi, Lo, and Drive pots are typically audio taper, but values vary. There were some capacitor and resistor value differences from unit to unit as well.
It was full wave rectified into 12VDC to work with the circuit. Those were half wave rectified into 12VDC. There were three versions made by Butler from  It had the LEDs placed above the screen printed text and was marked on top:. These are extremely rare as only about of them were made, and approximately of those were made with the jacks mounted on the sides, according to Butler.
The pcb was tan colored with the marking 9 on the trace side. Components were mounted on both sides. Eric Johnson used one on his album Tones, and has been a user ever since. The jacks were later permanently moved to the the rear end and the graphics were modifed so the LED's were moved below the text. The front markings also changed but I have only ever seen one example like this:.
Butler trusted Chandler in the beginning, but later decided he needed his name on the pedal. He made a revised version in identical to the one above, but the front markings were changed to:. Approximately of those were made using tan colored pcbs with a slightly different trace pattern that the previous pcb.
I have seen two slightly different sets of component values on that board. On a few that I have owned there was no volume until the Drive pot was dialed above 2. The sound also seems to vary greatly from one pedal to another. Some sound the same as next version, some different. Part of this could simply be due to part values drifting due to component aging. Various B. Butler Tube Driver circuits - circuit on left, in middle, and on right. Butler then had a firm in California manufacture a third version of the circuit board for him sometime in  The pcb was dark green on the trace side and had no identifying numbers or letters.
Most components were soldered on the front side, but a few caps and resistors were on the trace side. Approximately were made, and I have seen two slightly different sets of component values on this pcb. The two that I own sound nearly identical to each other, and identical to one of the Tube Drivers I own with the first version of the pcb.
These old model s Tube Drivers have a seven digit serial number engraved on the bottom. The first digit is the year made, next two digits are the month, next two digits are the day, and last two digits are the number in the batch. So serial number would be:. Some of the v versions that were made for export have "EX" marked in front of the serial number thanks to Tom for the photo.
Real Tube Users Manual. Designed in , but first made in under Butler's new Tube Works brand. Same op amp and 12AX7 Tube Driver circuit, but with a mid range knob added. Butler considered this version a superior pedal in some ways to his original 4 knob Tube Driver, which I agree with - the added mid range knob makes the tone much more versatile. These can sound slightly harsher and more fuzzy than the later Tube Driver at high gain, depending on the tube used, but at medium to low overdrive settings they can sound identical to the  No true bypass.
These were made around  Butler made a run of his Tube Driver car amplifiers with a gold anodized sheet metal enclosures.
He had some of the gold stock left over and thought it would look cool to make some gold cased Real Tubes. Some Tube drivers were made in gold as well. Butler says he made around 6 for Billy Gibbons, who used to give pedals away. There were probably more than 6 made, as I have seen several for sale, and own two myself. Unfortunately, over time the gold oxidizes and becomes spotted and rusted, but they are still a cool collectible.
The first version was marked on top:. A small number of these were made with gold tops. They were marked on top:. The ones made around are marked on top:.
The pedals were made with several different pcb's in this period and had different graphics and knobs than the US versions. The country of origin was on the bottom. Some Genz Benz versions have a 9v or 12v power adpator jack on the back rather than an AC power cord.
These are easily identified by a solid yellow rectangle around the footswitch. They are marked on top:. A smoother, lower gain version of the Real Tube.
Same pcb as the Real Tube. The primary difference from the circuit are a few different resistor values in the drive section and a smaller Hi pot value. Early production was made in the USA throughout the s and s. A small number of those were made with gold colored tops and blue printing.
After Genz Benz bought Tube Works in the late s a Taiwan made version with different knobs and graphics was produced throughout the s. Blue Tube Users Manual. It use the same pcb as the and  According to Butler, the Overlord was copied by DM out of spite after he left his company.
It is housed in a nearly identical enclosure, with the same knobs, and similar graphics as the Tube Works original. No BKB Butler markings. Chandler trademarked and owned the names Tube Driver and Real Tube Overdrive , so after Butler stopped making Tube Drivers for Chandler to market and distribute in , they copied his circuit and made this cheaper, simpler version in the USA.
Butler says this circuit is not his authentic design and includes mistakes. Some owners would disagree, but I think they do not sound very good at all and are EQ'd badly compared to the ones Butler made.
Some of these were built with an internal transformer like the original Tube Driver, but most were made with the power transformer on the outside. It was a plug in "wall wart" style transformer, but it was still hard wired to the Tube Driver by a long power cord. Chandler did this to prevent the hum noise associated with the transformer being inside the enclosure in proximity to the circuit, which is a common complaint among Tube Driver owners. Tube Driver Users Manual. After Chandler's trademark on the name Tube Driver lapsed in , Butler started making them again under his Tube Works brand.
This Tube Driver was a lower cost, entry level version, housed in a smaller enclosure. It had a slightly different voice and a simplified tone stage.
Compared to the 4 knob version, it had less volume on tap, sounded more like a fuzz or distortion pedal at high gain, and sounded a little harsher at low gain. Rather than the three-knob Fender style tone section of the Real Tube or four-knob Tube Driver, this version had a single Hi-Lo knob that dialed between bass and treble. At low drive settings it could sound very similar to the 4 knob version through many amplifiers, but obviously the single tone knob limited the possible EQ range so it could be difficult to get a good sound through some amplifiers.
It uses a 12Ax7 tube like the  It's not exactly the same sound, but very close. Behringer VT Butler started making the 4 knob Tube Drivers again as a production model under the Tube Works brand around  David Gilmour of Pink Floyd was seen using two s Tube Drivers in the studio and on tour in , which may have partly influenced the decision to bring these back to the market. I have seen s dated from  The circuit layout and pathways were very similar, but there were several component value changes across the circuit that affect the way it sounds.
These sound more like the 5 knob Real Tube circuit, but with a fixed resitor for the mid range instead of a mids knob. The enclosure was the same width as the original s version, but not as long. Standard Tube Works knobs were used, rather than the yellow-capped knobs used on the original s Tube Drivers.
The old Tube Works product numbering was continued, so this model was named , after the Porsche  The model number never appeared on the original pedals, but it was marked on the later Genz Benz Taiwan made version, which was also marked Genz Benz on the jack side of the enclosure. A tiny number of the US made Tube Drivers had a gold anodized finish on the case top.
Butler made a run of his Tube Driver car amplifiers with a gold anodized sheet metal enclosure. He had some of the gold stock left over and thought it would look cool to make some gold cased Real Tube and Tube Driver pedals. They are extremely rare and I have only seen four of them. Unfortunately, the gold oxidizes and becomes spotted and rusted, and it seems to get worse over time. I have never seen one in good condition.
The Genz Benz versions were made into the s.
