When scanning, you can save the document to your PC or to a memory device connected to the PictBridge port; reprint the scanned document; have it attached to an outgoing e-mail; or scan it into a number of programs such as Word, Paint, or PowerPoint or into one of HP's bundled utilities for editing.
Nor can you choose the destination--it defaults to your My Documents folder. You get more options if you initiate the scan from HP's bundled Solution Center utility, as opposed to using the control panel. And unlike the more expensive C, you can't scan negatives or slides on the C When you insert a memory card into one of the slots, you have a number of options.

And it only serves as a reference. Some HP multifunction photo printers and most Canon multifunction printers such as the Canon Pixma MP allow you to use an index sheet to select photos to be printed.
Considering that the C is a photo-centric printer with a flatbed scanner, we're surprised by the omission. It printed black text at a rate of 5. Already have an HP account?
