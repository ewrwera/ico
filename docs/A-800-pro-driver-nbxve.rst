We offer unmatched benefits including access to legal representation, fuel savings, emergency roadside assistance, travel discounts, bond payments, loss protection and more. This is not an insurance contract nor an automobile liability or physical damage policy.
Joining TVC Pro-Driver does not meet any legal or financial responsibility, but it does provide great value to professional drivers and their families. Our members receive support for all moving and non-moving violations.
For common issues such as following too close, speeding, logbook errors, overweight citations, equipment violations, and many others, our provider attorneys will represent you in the court of original jurisdiction. Exceptions include handling fees associated. Our provider attorneys will also represent you for serious charges like manslaughter, vehicular manslaughter, and negligent homicide. Your spouse will receive many of the same benefits as you, including personal vehicle roadside assistance.
However, if your spouse is a commercial driver, he or she will need a separate membership to receive CDL representation and protection. Sign up online or contact Customer Support at to discuss coverage. Our network of provider attorneys has worked more than 1 million violations for TVC Pro-Driver members.
Our attorneys are experienced with CDL cases and many have been part of our network for more than 30 years. Attorneys handle all cases in the court of original jurisdiction. In most cases, the member does not need to come to court, which is especially important for drivers who spend a lot of time on the road.
