The design is simple, most of the time where the diaphragm has a voice coil attached to the neck and the cone surround attached to the outer side of the diaphragm. The most common material used for cones of mid-range drivers is paper. At the same time, resins and polymers are being used more often now as the provide better vibrational damping than paper.
Hi-end drivers can also be made using fiberglass, carbon fiber light metal alloys or even Kevlar. Across the entire sound spectrum, mid-range speakers handle the most important part of it. First of all, mid-range is typically the busiest of all frequency ranges as most of the sounds we hear day-to-day fall within that range.
In addition, due to receiving mid-frequency range sounds on a constant basis, human ears have been trained to recognize discrepancies and distortions with ease. Secondly, most musical instruments sit, and most importantly — human voice sits within that range, which is critical to the overall sound quality of the song or soundtrack being played. In fact, the majority of basic sound reproduction devices such as radio, TV sets and many others, only have one driver which is a mid-range driver.
It is important to understand that reasonable sound quality can be achieved by only reproducing middle frequencies. The low range frequency gets reproduced by woofers and sub-woofers. The difference between woofers and sub-woofers is in the frequency range they are designed to reproduce with former typically working within the 40 Hz to Hz range and latter occupying sub Hz frequencies. Most consumer-grade loudspeakers combine woofers and sub-woofers into a single speaker, yet as you move up in the sound fidelity, those two get separated for purer, cleaner and more refined low-frequency sound.
A woofer, also called a bass speaker is a term for loudspeaker or a driver tasked with reproducing low frequency sounds. Most of the time, it features a electrodynamic driver made of strong paper or various polymers.
With some loudspeaker systems, the range covered by a woofer extends out to Hz or even Hz. In a practical sense, they leave the lower reproduction to sub-woofers and take on the woofer and mid-range speaker frequency delivery. Woofers are typically bigger, heavier and have significantly larger magnets than other speakers in the enclosure.
To reproduce the lower-end efficiently, the speaker has to have greater surface and more raw electric power, hence the bigger diaphragm and magnet. The amplifier low-frequency signal engages the magnet that pushes a relatively flat surface of the diaphragm to create a mechanical air movement. This makes vibration less frequent, but a lot more intense compared to other drivers in the enclosure. Sub-woofers are typically complete loudspeakers.
