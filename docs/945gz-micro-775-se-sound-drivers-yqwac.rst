I got that annoying constant "device plugged" then "device unplugged" message over and over again from the Realtek Hi-Def audio. Search the web and see others with this issue.
It solved the problem immediately. Overall Review: Well worth buying - great features, great price. It has some limitations but you'll pay more for a cruddy VIA board. This makes it a good choice for a full sized budget dual core builds. Pros: I purchased 6 of these. Used latest BIOS - just recently released. Stopped the message on 1 board, but lost front audio jack, didn't work at all on 2d board.
Go figure. Cons: I've listed most above. An issue is heat. On one system I OC'd a to 3. Either the sensors are off, or something very strange is up, as this is a standard chipset and certainly shouldn't be this hot. I question the sensors, as the boards should burn up pretty quickly at temps of degrees Fahrenheit or more. Does not matter what BIOS is used, or what utility, same readings. Not one system has had problems though. Strange to say the least. Pros: Great board.
Great price. I just built 4 systems with these. Excellent C2D support. To Juice anyone who builds knows you have to disable the "floppy drive seek" or "floppy drive" in the BIOS for most boards, or it will give the message you receive if you don't have floppy installed or don't want to boot off it. It is no reason to dis a great board. Asus, Gigabyte and MSI don't give you this info in any guide either. Cons: None. Everything is fully tested unless otherwise stated.
