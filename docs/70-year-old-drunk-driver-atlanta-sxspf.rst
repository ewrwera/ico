The streak of wrecks included a collision with a Toyota Camry that caused the impacted car to become wedged under the trailer of a tractor-trailer truck, killing a passenger.
Police told the Gwinnett Daily Post that the the spree abruptly ended shortly after that fatal collision, when Snider's Ford Super Duty pickup "veered off the road" and crashed into a restaurant. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Snider's attitude following the crashes was less than contrite. However, after he was made aware of the incident, he reportedly needed counseling, CBS Atlanta reports.
At least one driver accused Snider of targeting other cars on the road. Some, like Professor Isabella Ramirez of the University of Missouri, believe that the young woman was suffering from a psychosis and had, at least partially, lost any notion of reality. Others, like Dr. Gerald Porter, a well-known psychologist and expert in sexual disorders associated with the Institute of Psychological Sciences, believe that the accused is clearly a compulsive necrophiliac and that her choice of profession was inspired by her sexual deviation in the first place.
All seem to agree, however, that the year-old woman was suffering from mental problems and that she will probably register a plea of insanity. Males can achieve an erection well after death.
