They offer variable period guarantees on different models ranging from 1 to 3 years. One of the reasons I chose this particular model at the cost of being relatively more expensive was a 3 year warranty that came with it.
The computer comes with the original licensed version of Windows Home Basic. You also have a trial version of Norton Internet Security which you can purchase online from Symantec. I bought Norton Antivirus instead because it was sufficient for my needs. Using a licensed version entitles you to regular updates and security alerts — I highly recommend purchasing a system preloaded with the original software.
There are other models available which are quite cheaper but only ship with DOS and then you will have to load Windows separately. The one inconvenience which I most certainly think — they only provide a 30 day trial version of MS Office!! While not just with HP, none of the other brands provide it either, but as a customer I think Office is the most basic software everyone uses and should have been preloaded.
Now you are forced to spend a good sum to buy it or go for a hacked version. Global evaluation: HP gives you a whole new experience of using your PC. In particular, the ain is a powerful machine with its Core 2 Duo processor and you certainly have a reliable, sturdy and rugged system with this purchase.
The only thing you might consider is its price — the entire system including a Microtek inverter costs around INR 38,
