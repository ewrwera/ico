Next, we used each model to tighten the nuts for a total of five seconds and then used the wrench to determine the torque that each driver delivered. The torque wrench that we used for testing maxes out at foot-pounds of force, so we determined that models that could both reach and break a minimum of foot-pounds should earn a perfect score for the metric. The Makita XDT13 could only reach a torque of ft-lbs while tightening, but it was so quick at breaking ft-lbs that we opted to award it a perfect score as well.
The M18 averaged ft-lbs while tightening, while the DeWalt MAX followed at an average of ft-lbs — both of these models were able to break ft-lbs in under two seconds. The Porter-Cable had a slightly higher tightening average than these two models at ft-lbs, but when it came to breaking ft-lbs, it took this model nearly 10 seconds to pass the test.
Convenience is an important element of impact driver efficiency. To reach a numeric value for convenience, we examined the subtle differences between each model, including the bit holders, the quality and performance of the LED lights, the functionality of the quick connect hex head collet, and any other additional features. The top scorer in the convenience department was the Milwaukee M18 Fuel  This model offers a quick-release chuck, a belt hook, and a bit holder.
Additionally, it has four RPM settings, and we found the button to be easy to press and in a great location. One of our favorite aspects of this model is its size — it is only mm. One of the best bonus features that we found on the Ryobi is the innovative chuck. Not only is it a quick connect, inserting a bit into the driver cocks a spring-loaded disconnect that makes it very fast and easy to use. This model comes with a bit holder on the front of the handle and also includes a magnet plate for holding additional bits or fasteners.
The RPM switch, located on the driver's back, is very easy to see and access. The Milwaukee M12 Fuel is lightweight and small in size, and we appreciate these attributes about this model. It's about as compact and light as they come, ideal for folks without much storage stage or for pros hoping to carry a lighter load in their tool kit.
In addition, its small size makes the M12 Fuel great for driving into weird angles and harder-to-reach places. We love that the Makita XDT13 is so short — from front to back, it's only mm. Regrettably, this driver is devoid of RPM setting controls. Some of the drivers showed impressive battery life. Others, not so much. The Makita XDT13 did a good job of driving five sets of 14 ledger screws and four lag bolts in and out, but it eventually ran out of sauce while loosening the fifth lag bolt of the experiment.
The Milwaukee M18 Fuel completed four sets of the ledger screws and the lag bolt but died after driving four ledger screws on the fifth go around. While the Ryobi P couldn't quite keep up with the top models during our battery test assessment, it still outperformed most of its adversaries.
It got through 42 ledger screws and drove the lag bolt three times, but when trying to remove the lag bolt on the third round, the battery died. As far as noise is concerned, impact drivers are just, well, loud. Nevertheless, we decided to run some experiments and include the results in our overall assessment of these tools.
We used an SPL meter to measure the average decibel level that each model produced while in operation. Unfortunately, nearly every impact driver basically failed this metric because they all emit absurd amounts of noise. The only driver that was somewhat bearable was the Bosch PS41BN — we measured an average of 86 decibels with the SPL meter during the noise testing for this model. All of the other impact drivers were so insanely loud in this assessment that we chose to score them terribly low.

During our quest to find the best cordless impact drivers, we bought and tested the 12 most promising models on the market to put in a head-to-head, hands-on, battery-powered tool showdown. We measured, weighed, and timed dozens of variables but also looked for tiny details such as the usability of the bit holder as well as the pattern and effectiveness of the target lights.
We subjectively judged the comfort and ergonomics of each driver, but we also beat the heck out of them by effectively maxing out their torque capabilities. Top 12 Product Ratings.

For this Head-to-Head we list the bare tool and kit price [at the time of publication] for your review. We scored the tools as bare tools. Metabo HPT is the only tool that does not come as a bare tool, so we used their kit price. Every cordless power tool, at all levels from budget-priced to super-premium, has design compromises. First, of course, is the cost. For example, if you want more speed; you sometimes have to give up torque.
More torque? You might need to put up with heavier weight. Hilti also offers a year limited warranty! Makita came in first in two categories: TEK screw speed test, and decibel ranking. Coming in second for run-time, ergonomics and price and third for speed under load and the power testing. Milwaukee, on the other hand, came in first in three categories: Speed under load, power test, and TEK screw speed. They have a powerful and extremely fast impact driver.
What hurt Milwaukee was their third place rank in run-time, and fourth in ergonomics. Milwaukee also did not fare well in the grip and balance scores in the ergonomic section. The team all favored the thinner grip style on the impacts with the slide pack batteries, over the fatter stem pack styles.
Lastly, pricing and decibels hurt Milwaukee. DEWALT came in first in the ergonomics category, second in the speed under load, and fourth in the power test, decibel and price categories. We get lots of comments about how we make the final rankings. No problem. Simply remove that from the matrix above and re-rank them.

That being said all my batteries and tools are Milwaukee and I will be with them forever. Second in this test but number 1 in my heart. You guys set the bar when it comes to tool reviews. Keep up the amazing work! It would be great to know how fast their charging system takes to recharge. Thanks, Good to know. My current batteries are obviously past their shelf life, but took so long I never really noticed.
My current  Great review. I have the Bosch 12v, and I like it a lot, but I have a hard time taking out the batteries. I see that the Dewalt and Makita have different style batteries, are these as hard to remove. Name required. Mail will not be published required. Notify me of followup comments via e-mail.

Impact Driver Best Volt Cordless Impact Driver Evaluation Format Once again our team has put some serious time and effort into our Head-to-Head evaluation to bring you the most comprehensive information available. Features — an overall comparison of features and specifications. LED lighting Most cordless tools have an LED work light option, but it seems for a long time now that DEWALT has taken this work light seriously by adding 3 lights around the nose-cone, and programming this light to stay on the longest.
Rubber Over-mold While all of the tools have some sort of rubber over-mold, Metabo actually applied some on their trigger and the bottom of the battery.
Speed Change Function Four of the eight v impact drivers have a speed adjustment. Size and Weight Consideration volt impact driver designs by nature tend to be more compact than their 18 volt brethren. The following chart shows the results of this test: Milwaukee averaged 1. Run-time — Number of Screws Driven on a Charge Winner Bosch 3-inch framing screws were used to determine a run-time winner. Tool Temperature During the run-time testing it was observed that some of the tools were heating up, so at the end of the run-time test, temperature readings were taken of the tool and batteries.

August 4, at am. Thanks Rob for the great info Reply. But not by much. Milwaukee is deff stronger. But I dont really care. I have … Read more ». For some fastening tasks whether it is tight quarters or not, I reach for it just because of the ergonomics of it. Way more control on the screw as well. Nice review. I use the Dewalt 12V daily, mostly for working on power tools as a repair tech. Great tool for that, paired with the matching screwdriver.
More torque would be a drawback for me, as powertool clamshells and alloy cases are a little fragile. The slide batteries allow a slimmer handle, and the tool stands up on the work bench. For plenty of users, control is more important than power. So in the end it all works great tht we have a mix of tools.
