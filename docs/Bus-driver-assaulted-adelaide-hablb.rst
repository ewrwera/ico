The driver pulled over on Boundary St and the passenger left the scene. TWU senior branch official Matt Burnell said the incident was "horrific", and follows recent similar attacks which put driver and passenger safety at risk.
Mr Burnell said there had been an escalation in violence against bus drivers and described the current situation as a "bus driver safety crisis". Police on Thursday revealed a cyclist will face court over an assault on a bus driver at Marion Shopping Centre on June 3. Mr Burnell said a recent union survey showed 40 per cent of respondents believed driving had become more dangerous and nine per cent had been assaulted in the last three months.
