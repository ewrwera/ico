I am happy to report that the keyboard has no flex whatsoever, even pushing hard with both hands. The keys give good feedback but are a touch noisy when typing at full speed — reducing speed reduces noise accordingly, so the keyboard is certainly usable in no-noise situations. The touchpad itself is great — size is good, sensitivity is good. Simply a blessing while surfing the web, it is. They look and feel somewhat cheap, and I think Dell really dropped the ball here. Finally, I would have enjoyed some sort of a lighting option when it came to the keys.
Backlighting would have required some revamps to keyboard design, but I would have liked to see something like the lamp IBM has at the top of the LCD — a simple button press and your keyboard is illuminated! Of course, the inclusion of an optical drive is a huge plus in this size of notebook. I opted for the Intel Pro Wireless chipset, which offers  The included Intel Wireless application is clean and straightforward and is one of the nicest I have ever used.
The lack of integrated Bluetooth, even as an extra cost option, really grinds my gears. That being said, the 8 cell adds only a few ounces and sticks out an unobtrusive inch from the back of the machine — and easily doubles the battery life. To sum it up, I constantly and consistently get over 4. I have never had the battery last less than 4 hours under any normal use and have been pleasantly surprised when it has lasted more than 5 on a number of occasions.
I find that I can leave the AC adapter at home, throw my m into its case and leave the house for a few hours or a night without having to worry about it conking out before I return. Finally, the AC adapter is decently sized. I find the connector between the cord coming from the outlet and the adapter itself to be a bit odd, but this is made up by the very handy rubber strap that can be used to tie the whole deal together.
I booted the Inspiron m once when it was initially received, grimaced at XP Home and the plentiful amount of bloat, screamed like a little girl and promptly partitioned and formatted the hard drive and installed my own copy of XP on it. From the short look I had it seemed like a bunch of 90 day trials and other sorts of annoying useless software.
My one dealing was during a bit of indecision I was having when I heard about the launch of the XPS M and was seriously contemplating return my m to wait for its release. What a steal! Unfortunately it seems Dell has pulled the m from their lineup on the Canadian site, hopefully to be replaced by another ultraportable though most likely only to be replaced by the XPS M If the small screen size really worries you for home use, the m can easily be hooked up to your standard desktop components for more comfortable use.
When and how purchased I bought the Inspiron m online at Dell. Build and design Starting with the design, plain pretty much sums up the Inspiron m.
