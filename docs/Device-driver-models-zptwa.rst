Ask the following questions:. Can you avoid writing a driver entirely? If you must write a function driver, what is the best driver model to use? To answer these questions, determine where your device fits in the list of technologies described in Device and driver technologies. See the documentation for that particular technology to determine whether you need to write a function driver and to learn about which driver models are available for your device.
Some of the individual technologies have minidriver models. In a minidriver model, the device driver consists of two parts: one that handles general tasks, and one that handles device-specific tasks.
Typically, Microsoft writes the general portion and the device manufacturer writes the device-specific portion. The device specific portions have a variety of names, most of which share the prefix mini. Here are some of the names used in minidriver models:. For an overview of minidriver models, see Minidrivers and driver pairs.
Not every technology listed in Device and driver technologies has a dedicated minidriver model. The key point is that you should start by studying the documentation for your specific device technology. If your device technology has a minidriver model, you must use the minidriver model. The drivers are layered in a stack, and the conventional way to visualize the stack is with the first driver at the top and the last driver at the bottom.
The stack has one function driver and can also have filter drivers. For a discussion about function drivers and filter drivers, see What is a driver? Many of the system-defined device properties in the unified device property model have corresponding representations that can be used to access the same information on Microsoft Windows Server , Windows XP, and Windows  To maintain compatibility with these earlier Windows versions, Windows Vista and later versions of Windows also support these representations.
However, you should use the unified device property model of Windows Vista and later to access device properties. Skip to main content. This browser is no longer supported. Download Microsoft Edge More info. Contents Exit focus mode.
Entropy functions should not be directly used as a random number generator source as some hardware implementations are designed to be an entropy seed source for random number generators and will not provide cryptographically secure random number streams. Zephyr provides a set of device drivers for multiple boards. Each driver should support an interrupt-based implementation, rather than polling, unless the specific hardware does not provide any interrupt.
High-level calls accessed through device-specific APIs, such as i2c. Thus, these calls should be blocking. The following APIs for device drivers are provided by device. The APIs are intended for use in device drivers only and should not be used in applications. Create device object and related data structures including setting it up for boot-time initialization.
Declare a device object. Use this when you need a forward reference to a device that has not yet been defined. The device initialization macros populate some data structures at build time which are split into read-only and runtime-mutable parts. At a high level we have:. The config member is for read-only configuration data set at build time.
For example, base memory mapped IO addresses, IRQ line numbers, or other fixed physical characteristics of the device. The data struct is kept in RAM, and is used by the driver for per-instance runtime housekeeping. For example, it may contain reference counts, semaphores, scratch buffers, etc.
The api struct maps generic subsystem APIs to the device-specific implementations in the driver. It is typically read-only and populated at build time. The next section describes this in more detail. Most drivers will be implementing a device-independent subsystem API. Applications can simply program to that generic API, and application code is not specific to any particular driver implementation.
Since pointers to the API functions are referenced in the api struct, they will always be included in the binary even if unused; gc-sections linker option will always see at least one reference to them. Providing for link-time size optimizations with driver APIs in most cases requires that the optional feature be controlled by a Kconfig option. Some devices can be cast as an instance of a driver subsystem such as GPIO, but provide additional functionality that cannot be exposed through the standard API.
These devices combine subsystem operations with device-specific APIs, described in a device-specific header. A driver implementing extensions to the subsystem will define the real implementation of both the subsystem API and the specific APIs:. Public API for device-specific extensions should be prefixed with the compatible for the device to which it applies.
Some drivers may be instantiated multiple times in a given system. Each instance of the driver will have a different config struct and data struct. Configuring interrupts for multiple drivers instances is a special case. Drivers may depend on other drivers being initialized first, or require the use of kernel services. Any driver will specify one of four initialization levels:. These devices cannot use any kernel services during configuration, since the kernel services are not yet available.
Init functions at this level run on the interrupt stack. Used for devices that require kernel services during configuration. Init functions at this level run in context of the kernel main task.
Used for application components i. These devices can use all services provided by the kernel during configuration. Init functions at this level run on the kernel main task. Within each initialization level you may specify a priority level, relative to other devices in the same initialization level.
