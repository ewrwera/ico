I just pop the chip and plug it into a card reader and it works! Hi thanks for the wonderful help. It works. However, strangely it never asked for the Windows CD. I am able to read a recently purchased 32 GB drive. Thanks a ton. Would love to be in touch as I am a regular Win 98SE user courtesy my home recording setup that I started in  I think my problem had to do with the usb I was using.
I just picked up the cheapest 4gb one i could find at a nearby store and voila! Every time I try to open it a windows pops up asking me to format it. I get the windows telling me to format again. Thank you again.
It tries to boot up ok but runs into a stop that displays tht it has found the USB port and needs a driver for it. I tried several times with different versions of drivers, but this one did the job properly. Many, many thanks!!! The people who give their knowledge freely are to be commended. Thank youall sooo much. Sure wish I could do this job for the old lady. Can anyone help please.
Pam Vincent. After restart and after insertion of the USB flash drive it successfully installed itself. Thank you.
