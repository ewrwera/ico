Jan 21, 5 0 10 0. Greetings: I have a Dell Inspiron laptop. I was purchased in with Windows XP 32 bit. This being said, the architecture of the laptop is 64 bit. I have downloaded the 64 bit version of Windows 10 Home install disk onto a usb flash drive, and did a fresh install of the OS onto the laptop. The install went fine, short of having to find and install a driver for the Ricoh card reader.
I found it, and all the hardware is listed as working properly, with the Windows 10 drivers. It is currently an unlicensed copy. I want to test it to make sure it works, as well as being realistic to use, on the laptop. If it is, I will purchase the license. If it doesn't, I will have the laptop recycled.
I've had Linux Mint 64 bit installed on it before, but I want my daughter to have a Windows machine at home for bare bones tasks basic web browsing, email, word processing, as well as having the computer's OS compatible with her school. It's not lightning fast, but it's acceptable. The only exception is watching, say, a youtube video. The video can playback choppy. I wondered if it was a driver issue with the video card, so I found a legacy driver for an older Windows OS in 64 bit can't remember if it was a Vista or Windows 7 driver, but it works, but doesn't resolve the issue.
Thanks in advance. If anyone is searching for the solution to the question above, I figured it out. Windows 10 uses a generic video driver, which does work, but when using a 64 bit driver meant for the video card back in the days of Vista, the video becomes a lot crisper, and the driver seems to work just as well as the generic video driver supplied by Windows  Here is a working link to download the driver from ATI.
If you try to update with the Vista driver by selecting Update Driver from Device Manager, you'll be told the latest driver is already installed the generic Windows 10 driver. Go through the steps.
