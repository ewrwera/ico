Federal law requires interstate bus drivers to submit to random drug testing while on duty and pass a physical exam every two years. Being a bus driver can be somewhat stressful when dealing with passenger, traffic, and weather issues. Drivers must be able to remain calm and drive safely when dealing with these circumstances. The BLS notes that transit and intercity bus drivers have among the highest rates of injury for all occupations it tracks and notes that those injuries are mostly related to traffic accidents.
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has set rules that bus drivers must follow to ensure safety. For example, drivers are required to take at least an eight-hour break after driving for 10 consecutive hours. Other rules and restrictions vary depending on types of routes. School bus drivers usually drive their routes in the morning before school starts, when school lets out, and as needed for additional school events and activities.
Local and intercity transit drivers work varying schedules depending on their routes. They may need to drive nights, weekends, early mornings, or holidays. Charter bus drivers often have the most varying schedules, and they may be on the road for days at a time, depending on their clients' needs.
A solid resume will help you stand out in a pool of applicants. Not sure where to start? Use a resume template or resume builder. Many employers require bus driver candidates to pass a background check before hiring them. Prepare by finding out what a background check entails. The federal government and some states require people with a CDL to provide a copy of their Medical Examiner's Certificate to their licensing agency to make sure that they meet the physical requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations.
