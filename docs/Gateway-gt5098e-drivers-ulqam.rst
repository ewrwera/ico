If you have gotten the overclocking options unlocked I'd like to get a copy from you. If I can get my blue light back and still overclock it, it's be extremely happy lol. I didn't have any success modding it for overclocking on my first attempt, and I haven't revisited it yet. Awesome, thanks. Good luck modding it, if I may ask how do you mod the bios?

Hey guys, was reading your thread and thought I'd pop in. I have the same motherboard and it started to have a problem.. I'd turn it off and turn it back on and it was fine. July 4th, it started to only have the fans on max. I messed with the cmos and removed the battery, after several tries it booted -- but with all CMOS settings lost. I contacted gateway but they say its no longer under warranty and it will be about bucks to replace the board.
When you guys say that you killed your bios, was the same thing happening? I'm just wondering if the bios went bad or if there's another problem. I already removed the board from the system to make sure it wasnt a grounding issue. Disconnected everything except power and still no go. Also tried with one stick of ram, no go.
This is a really nice system and i'd hate to just "throw it away". If worse comes to worse, I'm willing to sell it as is, if anyone wants. Thanks in advance. The stock PSU's are not that good, when they go they usually take the Northbridge with them. Pull off the HS from the northbrige and see how it looks. If you got one try a diff PSU. Have you ever redone the thermal paste on the CPU. Last edited: Jul 23,  Hey there I managed to get another PSU from work, the board still wont post.
I've tried leaving everything off but the ram, still no post. I've tried another harddrive, still no post. I'm not sure if theres any options left. Thanks for your help guys.
