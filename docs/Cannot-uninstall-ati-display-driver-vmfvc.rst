The goal here is to get into safe mode with only the default VGA driver installed. Windows , XP, and Vista sometimes install drivers for you anyway so you need to try to stop them. Once you are in safe mode disable any anti-virus scanner you have running and run Driver Sweeper. Go to the "select" box on the left and click on the driver you want to sweep. Then the selected driver will show up in the "Remove" box on the right.
If you've selected the wrong one then click the " If the uninstall which you did just before rebooting into safe mode was succesful, then reboot and you're done. But if that uninstall had problems or you couldn't do it, then you may have a little tidying up to do.
There probably won't be anything but if there is, then try to remove them one last time. You should also go into the "Device Manager" and look for display drivers. After Driver Sweeper runs they may show up as disabled.
Uninstall them as described above. There may be one or more reboots to go through this tidying up process. Your goal is to eliminate any signs of the old display drivers or supporting programs like control panels.

Here you should find an ATI Technologies key. Select it and delete it. In that same section, look for an Installed Options key. Expand it and there you should find another ATI Technologies key.
Select it and erase it. Once all this is done, close the registry. Close all windows and reboot. Cancel that. Once complete, reboot and you are done. For all those who do not like going into the registry and rather have an easy to use program to do it for you, you can grab a nifty tool called "RegCleaner" here and it will do it for you without getting your hands dirty in the registry.
Follow steps 1 through 4 as stated above, then run RegCleaner to do the rest. Once completed, follow steps 8 and 9 and you are DONE!

Last edited: Jun 15,  Ghosty , Jun 15,  You have too much time on your hands. Also show how rubbish the registry is at removing files when programs are no longer installed. Nice post, guys can finally see how much work it is to clean out driver installs manually.
This ought to be a thorough clean for sure. Cheers mate. AmiloMan , Jun 15,
