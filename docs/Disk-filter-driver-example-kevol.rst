Before you automatically deploy a driver, you must provision the target computer. For instructions, see Provision a computer for driver deployment and testing.
On the host computer, in Visual Studio , in Solution Explorer , right click package lower case , and choose Properties. Check Enable deployment , and check Remove previous driver versions before deployment. For Target Computer Name , select the name of a target computer that you provisioned previously.
Select Do not install. Click OK. On the target computer, open Control Panel. Under View your active networks , click the connection listed under Connections: and click Properties. If you have previously installed this sample, highlight it in the list. If so, highlight the newest one. Highlight the netlwf. Click Close. This installs the Ndislwf filter driver service. If you've installed the Ndislwf sample on the target computer before, you can use the PnPUtil tool to delete the older versions from the driver store.
Before you manually deploy a driver, you must turn on test signing and install a certificate on the target computer. You also need to copy the DevCon tool to the target computer. Filter drivers are different from device function drivers, software drivers, and file system drivers, which we cover in other topics. To learn about filter drivers and how they differ from other types of drivers, see the following topics. To begin, first determine which driver model is appropriate for your filter driver.
For help determining which model is best for you, see Choosing a Driver Model. If you are writing a filter driver for a hardware device, determine where your device fits in the list of technologies described in Device and Driver Technologies.
See the documentation for that particular technology to see whether there is any guidance for choosing a filter driver model. The recommended filter driver model varies from one technology to the next. For other technologies, the documentation gives explicit details on how to write a filter driver. Some technologies have mini filter models. For some technologies, there might not be any recommendation for a filter driver model. Next, determine which of the following cases describes your driver model recommendation and follow the steps:.
