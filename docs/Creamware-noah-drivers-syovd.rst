Enter the Noah Photo: Mark Ewing One of the oldest criticisms levelled at computer-based music systems concerns their use in live situations, where stability and reliability are of paramount importance — factors that some people have problems associating with computers. This is becoming less of an issue with modern, stable operating systems such as Windows XP and Mac OS X, as evidenced by the number of musicians now taking to the stage with laptops.
However, there are still some things you just can't do with a laptop — the most obvious being that you can't use PCI cards. TC have now come up with a solution for this situation in the form of a Firewire-based Powercore system, which goes some way towards solving the problem of using computer-based DSP systems without having to bring your desktop computer along for the ride.
However, you do still need a computer to drive the Firewire Powercore, of course, which doesn't do much for those people who'd rather not use a computer in the first place. And it's not just in live situations where computers have traditionally not been welcome — some people simply don't want to use a computer in the studio, or they don't want the computer to be at the centre of everything, running instruments, effects, mixers, and the program to generate the week's lottery numbers.
This situation leads to an interesting paradox: musicians want to be able to use the instruments and effects available for computer-based systems, with or without additional DSP power, but not every musician wants to use a computer in every situation. Two companies have announced products to cater for this need: Manifold Labs, whose Plugzilla is a stand-alone rack unit capable of running a selection of VST plug-in instruments and effects, and Creamware, whose new Noah is the focus of this review.
However, since the code for the SFP devices is written specifically for SHARC DSP chips, rather than for the host's Motorola or Intel processor, it would, in theory, be possible to build a stand-alone platform to host the SFP, doing away with the need for a computer — and this is exactly what Creamware have done to create Noah.
It's worth pointing out that although the Noah is an open platform, in that it can run different devices, conceptually it's not that different to any other DSP-based synth currently available, such as the Access Virus, Clavia Nord Lead, and so on. The big difference is that where these instruments are designed for a single purpose, Noah's open design gives it the potential to be any instrument Creamware can dream up, whether that's today or a year from now. Noah's chameleon-like nature creates something of marketing problem for Creamware: how do you sell an instrument that has the potential to be any instrument?
The answer lies in the first instruments Creamware have chosen to ship with the Noah — since the company has a great deal of experience in modelling classic synths, the Noah concept is based around the idea of providing an ark for all your favourite synths.
Ark, Noah; get it? Well, it's worth remembering that Germans are as noted for their sense of humour as we English are for our extravagant national cuisine. Although, perhaps not by coincidence, we were experiencing torrential rain when the Noah arrived at the SOS office Noah is available in two versions: Noah and Noah EX. Both are 2U rack units — the original plans for a keyboard version seem to have been put on hold at present. We were sent a Noah EX for review, although I'll refer to both models generically when I talk about 'Noah' in this review, unless otherwise stated.
Photo: Mark Ewing. The front panel has a fairly distinctive appearance with a metallic silver finish screen-printed in navy blue, and rounded off with a 2 x 40 LCD display, a Compact Flash card slot, some buttons, and a set of rotary controllers, which are coloured, rather tastefully, in black, white, and, er, yellow. To be fair, Noah is quite pleasant to look at, although some of the controls — the four yellow rotary controllers in particular — aren't stepped and do feel a little bit fragile given its overall cost, which raised a few eyebrows amongst colleagues in the SOS office.
However, I didn't have an issue with these controllers when I was using Noah — it was the headphone control that had my eyebrows adopting a more Vulcan-like shape. On the front panel is a quarter-inch headphone jack with an associated volume control that doubles as a button for triggering previews of the currently selected instrument and preset. I never knew it was possible to be intimidated by a headphone volume control before using the Noah, but for some reason Creamware have opted to use the same type of endless rotary controller they do for Noah's other front-panel knobs, providing no obvious indication of how loud the headphone output is going to be.
The plus side is that the headphone level will always be the same as you left it when you last switched off Noah, regardless of whether you've accidentally touched the headphone control in the interim — the down side is that you won't actually know whether this level will be set to silence or ear-shredding before it's too late.
Turning our attention to the back panel, we find Noah's fairly comprehensive selection of inputs and outputs. This is mostly excusable, since Noah is primarily designed for playing synths, but as it can also act as an effects unit, it seems a shame that the only way you can get audio into Noah without a computer is via an analogue input.
Noah has a built-in power supply with a fan, although it's pretty quiet — you'd notice the fan if you were in a room with just Noah, but it's not at all distracting in the studio. Although you don't get the SFP's Routing window unlike with a PCI-based SFP system, you aren't able to change the way Noah's devices interact with each other because of the fixed architecture , the editor windows for Noah's instruments are all identical to the desktop versions, and this highlights the big advantage of using the computer-based editor.
Rather than having to navigate pages of menus and figuring out which rotary controllers to turn, you can see all the parameters on the screen in front of you in one window, and this really does make life easier.
The same goes for setting up MIDI, programming the step sequencer and anything else you might want to do, especially since you can see all these editor windows at once if your monitor is big enough! However, while editing on Noah is unsurprisingly easier via a computer, the neat thing is that you can edit everything and prepare your presets via the computer, but then disconnect it and take Noah on stage or to another studio, with all of your settings stored.
The only problem I encountered with the remote-control software is that some of the actions you perform in the software aren't always reflected visually on Noah. For example, if I was playing preset 1 on Minimax and changed to preset 10 on the remote-control software, I found that its display would still be set to preset 1, although Noah would play preset 10 correctly.
This wouldn't be such a big issue, but if I then pressed the increment button on Noah's front panel, preset 2 would be selected rather than preset  I couldn't find any way to solve this, no matter how I set up the synchronisation features for communication to and from the Noah and the remote-control software.
This should add a great deal of flexibility and ease of use when it comes to sharing presets between a SCOPE card and a Noah, because although SFP instruments aren't themselves compatible with the Noah, as mentioned elsewhere in this review, their presets do appear to be.
While the introduction to this review described the Noah as an instrument that doesn't require a computer, which is true, it's still possible to connect Noah to a Windows-based computer, enabling you to edit and prepare patches using the same attractive on-screen interface designs as if you were running a PCI-based SCOPE system see the Remote Control box for more information.
But the USB connection does more than just facilitate editing by remote-control — Noah can also act as a MIDI and audio interface for your PC, potentially eliminating the need for an additional computer interface. Although Noah is designed to help musicians do away with a computer in some situations, ironically, it also has great promise for being the centrepiece of a computer-based production system — a Noah with a laptop would be a great portable system for SFP instruments, for example.
At this point, I just want to mention that despite Creamware's advertising for Noah, where the unit is pictured with a sexy Apple G4 Powerbook, I didn't leave anything out in the last paragraph where I mentioned connecting Noah to a Windows-based computer.
Unfortunately, Mac support isn't here yet, so Mac users really will have to use Noah as a stand-alone device, although support is planned in the not-too-distant future. This allows for a degree of flexibility in that you can trigger different parts of Noah from different MIDI interfaces, but, by default, your computer won't receive MIDI input from a keyboard attached to Noah until you route that input to USB.
When it comes to using Noah as an audio interface, the USB interface provides two inputs as a stereo pair from the computer to the Noah, and six outputs as three stereo pairs from the Noah to the computer. While the Noah doesn't have any digital inputs, as discussed earlier, it's possible to get around this by using your USB connection. However, Noah's aspiration to be at the centre of your computer-based setup is currently hampered by the lack of ASIO drivers — only ordinary Windows audio drivers are provided at the moment.
ASIO drivers 'are planned for a later release', according to the manual, but I was a little disappointed by this, as it does limit Noah's current usefulness as an audio interface. One of the design points of the Noah that surprised me was the fact that every function and parameter is accessible from the front-panel controls. Before actually using Noah, I had previously thought of it in a similar way to an instrument like Clavia's Nord Modular, for example, where a computer was required for full editing, and the unit itself would be more of a 'playback' device when used in stand-alone mode.
But every function and parameter is indeed accessible from the front-panel controls, which presents both advantages and also a couple of disadvantages. There's no digital input per se, though digital input is possible via the USB connection. Noah Ex a light capable of providing almost the same as its predecessor polyphony at the cost of publishing on PC mandatory and disappearance of certain assets of Noah Ex multitimbral plugs with several different arpeggiator stepsequencer, provided greater effects including reverb, complete edition possible without PC.
But the adventure continued in another form and gave the Solaris under the leadership of John Bowen Noah EX is an expander. The device is extraordinary, since the intgre soft to hard. Nanmoins, for those who are broken using vsti, Noah does not Drout, quite the contrary. Noah the expensive side, but the quality is paid. Isolment taken, it does not rvle all its power.
The Resource Access of Noah instruments, effects, etc Note when you come to buy bte: do not forget Note when you come to buy bte: do not forget to switch to other lists of presets not Factory to capture the rich sound The device offers a near perfect modlisation of synthtiseurs recognized.
The Noah is a technological marvel probably Designed for those who love the sound. Mention particulire SixStrings plug-in, which I think has no rival on the market. The Noah is a vritable monster. I do not notice too ngatif of a user. Or it was a device dfectueux or he forgot to read the instructions. The Noah is undoubtedly one of the best synthtiseurs available on the market that, in addition to instruments, effects and intgre a mix of quality.
I forgot the squenceur and the arpeggiator which I couple rgulirement to Minimax Powerful synthesizer with arpeggiator and sequencer. I have version 11 DSP is really powerful I saw on the site a person putting a negative I do not agree at all With 11 DSP, you can play up to four instruments at the same time If you are patient and we know what we want If I had to buy it Everything has already been said So we must create its presets either manually menu accessible from the front not super ergonomic admittedly on a computer with Windows XP or OSX Browse the list above to find the driver that matches your hardware and operating system.
