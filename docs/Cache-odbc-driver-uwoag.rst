Anything - 7. However, a 7. Anything , but would not cover any version of 7. For example, a technology approved with a decision for  References The following reference s are associated with this entry: Type Name Source Description There are no references identified for this entry. Technology Components Note: This list may not be complete. No component, listed or unlisted, may be used outside of the technology in which it is released.
The usage decision for a component is found in the Decision and Decision Constraints. Name Description No components have been identified for this entry. Runtime Dependencies: No runtime dependencies have been identified. General Analysis Adoption Benefits There are no known security vulnerabilities associated with this technology at the time of writing.
This technology is portable to multiple VA supported platforms. Go to site. The output of this product will be assessed for compliance at a later date. The driver could default to receiving the column as Unicode, however, this may result in as many as two unnecessary conversions. The default encoding of the Oracle client is used when fetching data.
Example 1: Connection to Database. Example 2: Simple Retrieval. Example 4: Simple Update. The following example retrieves the employee names and the job titles from the EMP table. This example shows how to update data. This example may be the most complicated case to update and retrieve data for long data, like CLOB , in Oracle. This section describes some general programming tips to improve the performance of an ODBC application. Enable connection pooling if the application will frequently connect and disconnect from a data source.
Reusing pooled connections is extremely efficient compared to reestablishing a connection. Minimize the number of times a statement must be prepared.
Where possible, use bind parameters to make a statement reusable for different parameter values. Preparing a statement once and executing it several times is much more efficient than preparing the statement for every SQLExecute.
This topic discusses performance implications of the following ODBC data source configuration options:. Enable Result Sets. Enable Closing Cursors.
Enable Thread Safety. Fetch Buffer Size. This option enables the support of returning result sets for example, RefCursor from procedure calls. The default is enabling the returning of result sets. The ODBC Driver must query the database server to determine the set of parameters for a procedure and their data types to determine if there are any RefCursor parameters.
This query incurs an additional network round trip the first time any procedure is prepared and executed. Enable LOBs. The application can reopen the cursor by executing the statement again without doing a SQLPrepare again.
A typical scenario for this is an application that is idle for a while but reuses the same SQL statement. While the application is idle, it might free up associated server resources.
The cursor and associated resources remain open on the database server. Enabling this option causes the associated cursor to be closed on the database server.
However, this results in the parse context of the SQL statement being lost. Enabling this option severely impacts performance of applications that prepare a statement once and execute it repeatedly. If an application is single-threaded, this option can be disabled.
By default, the ODBC Driver ensures that access to all internal structures environment, connection, statement are thread-safe. Single-threaded applications can eliminate some of the thread safety overhead by disabling this option. Disabling this option typically shows a minor performance improvement. This value determines how many rows of data at a time the ODBC Driver prefetches from an Oracle database to the client's cache, regardless of the number of rows the application program requests in a single query, thus improving performance.
Setting this too high can worsen response time or consume large amounts of memory. The default is 64, bytes. Choose a value that works best for your application.
To prevent incorrect results as might happen if the parameter value had nonzero fractional seconds , the optimizer applies the conversion to the HIREDATE column resulting in the following statement:. Unfortunately, this has the effect of disabling the use of the index on the HIREDATE column and instead the server performs a sequential scan of the table.
If the table has many rows, this can take a long time. This allows the query optimizer to use any index on the DATE columns. Microsoft Access executes such queries using whatever columns are selected as the primary key. This chapter contains the following sections: Topics:. A standard set of error codes. A standard way to connect to and log in to a data source.
A standard representation for data types. Support is added for time stamp with time zone and time stamp with local time zone. New parameters in the odbc.
Statement Caching Added support for OCI statement caching feature that provides and manages a cache of statements for each session. Note: There is an impact on performance each time a cursor is closed. Note: This feature is not implemented for Oracle Database 12 c Release 1  Reducing Lock Timeout. Error messages have the following format: [vendor] [ODBC-component] [data-source] error-message The prefixes in brackets [ ] identify the source of the error.
Note: Although the error message contains the [Ora] prefix, the actual error may be coming from one of several sources. PWD Password User-supplied password. The default is 60, bytes. The default is  PWD The user-specified password. See Also: Reducing Lock Timeout for more information on specifying a value in the oraodbc. The complete name of a SQL Server procedure consists of up to four identifiers:.
Migrated procedures are often reorganized and created in schemas in one of these ways: All procedures are migrated to one schema the default option. All procedures owned by one user are migrated to the schema named with that user's name. Example How to Set Up the Environment The following example sets up the environment for the example sections that follow.
All rights reserved. This option enables the support of inserting and updating LOBs. Enable this option only if freeing the resources on the server is absolutely necessary. Oracle database limits literals in SQL statements to 4, bytes. Driver Manager. Oracle server. User-supplied name. TNS Service Name. User ID or User Name. User-supplied password. Database Attribute. Applications Attributes. Result Sets. Query Timeout Option. Close Cursor. Disable Rule Hint. Batch Autocommit Mode. User-supplied numeric value specify a value in bytes of 0 or greater.
Failover Retry Count. User-supplied numeric value. Failover Delay. LOB Writes. Microsoft Transaction Server Support. EXEC Syntax. Schema Field. Set Metadata ID Default. Numeric Settings. Token Size. The name of the data source. The user login ID or user name. The user-specified password. See the information that follows. All catalog functions. For a particular vendor database, that vendor may offer its own version of the ODBC client driver for that platform.
This may be preferred in some cases because the vendor driver may take advantage of its knowledge of how the database works internally to optimize performance or enhance reliability. For an application to connect to a database via ODBC, the application must generally provide the following connection details:.
Information on locating and accessing the database. For example, this may include the server on which the database resides and the port to use when connecting to it. The details needed depend upon the database technology. Login credentials to access the database, if the database is protected by a password. In most cases, this information is stored within a DSN, which has a logical name for use within the client application. The DSN may or may not include login credentials, which can also be stored in the database initialization file, or not stored at all.
