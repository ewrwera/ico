If the INF file references a file that is not included in the driver package, the driver package is not copied to the store. The process of copying a driver package to the Driver Store is called staging. A driver package must be staged to the Driver Store before the package can be used to install any devices.
As a result, driver staging and device installation are separate operations. Before a driver package is staged to the Driver Store, the operating system first verifies that the driver package is trusted. In order for the driver package to be considered trusted, the INF file must have a CatalogFile directive in the Version section that provides the file name for a catalog file that is associated with the INF file. The catalog file must contain hashes for the INF file and any files that are referenced by the INF file and the catalog file must be signed with a trusted digital signature.
