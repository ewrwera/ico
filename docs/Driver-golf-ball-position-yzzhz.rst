Take the width of your stance by stepping away from the target with your trail or back foot to get the width of your stance. The width of your trail heel should be just underneath your trail shoulder. Both of which are very important to understand the concept as well as be able to control.
To find your proper ball position hybrids or fairway woods, like for the other clubs so far, put your feet together. Now, it is time to get your stance width for your hybrids. Ball position for your hybrids will start by getting yourself in position to create a straight line between where your big toe on your lead foot left foot for right handed players and the golf ball.
See the video above. Similar to what you have done before, next, turn or flare your lead or front foot out towards the target. This simply means turn your toes on your lead foot left for a right handed player towards the target. Again, your heel needs to stay where it is while you are flaring your toes.
If you move that foot forward towards the target, you are moving your ball position back in your golf stance and making the club work more vertically. Now, step away with your trail or back foot to get the width of your stance.
The width will vary depending on the club that you are attempting to hit. Since a wedge is one of the shorter clubs in your bag, I would suggest that your trail heel stay inside of your trail shoulder. This will allow you to better control low point and pressure in your lead foot through impact. This is very important to hitting good and consistent golf shots. To find your proper ball position for driver, just like last time, start by placing your feet together. After that, get into a position that creates a straight line between where your big toe on your lead or front foot left foot for right handed players and the ball.
Sound familiar? Yes, It is just like your hybrids and fairway woods. As with the direction s above, the next step would be to turn or flare your lead foot out towards the target.
I find that many students need more lead foot flare than they currently use. It allows them to turn more towards the target while maintaining balance and not placing as much stress on their hip knee and ankle joint. Again, your left heel needs to stay exactly where it is. If you move that foot towards the target, you are moving your ball position back in your golf stance.
Now it is time to get the width of your driver stance. Pick up your trail or back heel and move it so that it is just outside of your trail shoulder. You will need to keep in mind that if your heels become too far apart that it will do a couple of things.
First, it will move your low point too far behind the golf ball. Second, it will become more difficult to get your weight back on your lead foot left foot for a right handed player. The ball will look more forward or to the front to you than it has in the past. You should now have a good plan to create your golf ball position, play better golf and enjoy the game more. Are you tired of playing bad golf even though you are doing the work?

Golf Ball Position for a "Stock Shot" So, as we discuss what is the correct ball position in golf, keep in mind, that we were talking about a stock golf shot. What did Jack do With His Ball The longer I teach the game of golf the more and more the answer is becoming First, put your feet literally next to each other.
Buy It Here. Here's how to make sure your ball position is correct. Tee it up in line with the logo on your shirt, or just inside your left heel. For shorter clubs, the ball should stay in line with the logo, but the stance should be narrower, making the ball more centered relative to the body.
As for distance from the ball, the butt of the grip at address should be about six inches from your body. Check this by setting up and then taking your right hand off the grip, moving it about a foot to your right. You shouldn't feel like you have to reach to put it back on the club. Playing the ball in the correct place takes no athletic ability, it's just remembering to monitor it.
You're actually going to be hitting a little bit down on the driver, just as they do on the PGA Tour. The average attack angle for a driver on the PGA Tour is negative 1 degree, so that means they're hitting down and through. It's a very slight amount, but they're still hitting down and through. If you want to bomb your driver, you want to get maximum distance, get a really high launch angle and hit it as far as possible, you're going to need closer to a positive four 4 attack angle.
What that means is we're going to place the ball a little bit farther forward, more off the inside of your left foot. That's going to allow you to make the same swing again, and you're going to be catching the ball a little bit more on the upswing.
When you do this, you're going to have to make some compensations. As I mentioned, this swing is on an arc. If I move this ball forward, my club's actually going to be moving back to the left as I make contact with the ball.
That means the face is going to be closing a bit, so the compensation you're going to have to make is line up everything a little bit to the right. That means your feet, knees, hips, shoulders, club - everything's going to be lined up a little bit more to the right. That way as your club starts to release as you're hitting it more on the upswing, it's going to be dead straight.
If you don't want to make any compensation with your golf swing, you're going to need to line up a little bit right and make the same swing. Again, for maximum consistency one ball position, everything off the left ear, no matter if it's a driver or a pitching wedge. If you want to bomb your driver, you can move the golf ball position a little bit forward but you're going to have to close your stance.
One of the mistakes I see with irons constantly is people playing the golf ball too far back in their stance. When you get the ball too far back in your stance - you can imagine if I'm playing the ball back here on my right foot - this is really going to steepen the angle of attack. This can lead to a lot of chunks. It can also lead to a lot of blocked shots or hooks. Let me explain that a little bit. If the ball is back in my stance If we move it too far back, now the club is going to swing out to the right because this is at an arc.
If I don't square the face, I'm going to hit a block. If I square the face too much and my path is going that far to the right, I'm going to hit a hook. Plus, I'm coming in really steep. The key, again, make sure you have one constant ball position off the left ear for every club in the bag, and you're going to have maximum consistency and play some great golf.
