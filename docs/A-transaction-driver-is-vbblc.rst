A distributed transaction updates data on two or more networked databases while retaining the important atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable ACID properties of transaction processing. The management of distributed transactions is typically performed automatically by the Java Transaction Service JTS transaction manager in a Java EE application server environment. MS DTC uses proven transaction processing technology from Microsoft to support XA features such as the complete two-phase distributed commit protocol and the recovery of distributed transactions.
For more information about how to use distributed transactions, see Understanding XA transactions. Performing transactions with the JDBC driver. Skip to main content.

This tells me a lot about the way they see the world and gives me an insight into how their childhood might have been.
Drivers are a way in which we have learnt to be as children in order for us to stay feeling OK. They can be a double edged sword. Although often they can be useful they also cost us and we pay in stress or anxiety when we are not able to fulfill the driver behaviour we are programmed with.
They often eat fast and talk fast, not giving themselves time to enjoy the things that they are doing. They put an enormous amount of effort into the detail and will not settle until things are exactly right. This can mean that their work is to a high standard but they will have paid in anxiety and time to get it that way.
The driver saves the handles to these transaction objects. Each time the driver is ready to create and initialize a new transaction, it calls WdfDmaTransactionCreate. If the driver uses one of its stored transaction objects, it should reuse the transaction object, instead of deleting it, when the transaction is completed.
