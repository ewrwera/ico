The maximum reading and writing speeds are standard with this model. Even despite the fact that Dell lacks a USB 3. It uses USB 2. We do like how fast the DW is rewriting data from disks.
How handy is that! We definitely adore the minimalist design the Dell DW has. It is slim, lightweight, and accurate. The upper part has a glossy black coating with a noticeable company logo in the center.
It looks nice. Plus, in a combo with rounded corners, the glossy casing gives the drive a cool look. The only flaw of such a design - it splotches easily, so you might want to wipe the unit pretty often. The front panel is also made neat. There is only one button that opens the disk tray.

The Silent Play technology is another handy feature this drive supports. When you place a disk into a drive it automatically determines the multimedia type, adjusts the optimal reading speed, and reduces the noise. The opportunity to burn M-discs is a cherry on the pie here. The drive is compatible with the M-Disk technology so that you could save all your important information for a long time.
This kind of disks are more durable and even in 10 years, all your data will be stored without distortion. The LG Electronics 8X is made solid, lightweight, and very small. It has a stylish and elegant case with an ultra-thin profile of 0.
