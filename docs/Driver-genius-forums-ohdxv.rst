However if your machine is working fine why would you risk getting the latest drivers? Apr 24, 1 0 10, 0. I always use Slim Drivers when I do a fresh install. It saves me time and effort. Not every PC you come across has a simple manufacturer's website to easily find drivers on; for example there may be custom hardware. You still have to use discretion to tell if each driver it finds is correct, but for the most part I haven't had a problem. I keep it on a usb with several other "fresh install" programs.
I inherit a ton of free old PCs from my mom's work, so I end up using it often. Aug 28, 1 0 10, 0. Ijack :. Dark Lord of Tech Retired Moderator.

Apps General Discussion. On the above screen you will see I have deslected the bottom update. You should always do the same as it is not actually a driver update. When it is checked, it downloads and installs the new version of Kingsoft antivirus - which will be of no use since it's in Chinese only.
You can also uncheck any drivers you don't want to download. To download and install the available drivers, press the button with text ending in N , and then do the same on the next screen. Now Driver Genius will go about download and installing all the drivers. Multiple drivers are download at once to speed up the download process.
Once a driver has finished downloading, the installer for the driver will be launched and the other drivers will continue to download. After a driver is installed be sure to select not to reboot if prompted to do so.
This will let Driver Genius continue download and installing all the drivers. When this is done you can reboot if you you prompted to reboot after installing any drivers. Doing the "update to the latest graphics driver" thing has burned me more than once, with both the red and green team.
Example: my in-law's computer had a Geforce card. Updated to the latest drivers, since it was using old as hell drivers. Some pretty basic game with 2d graphics started blue screening the PC every time. Granted this is on XP, but as of this post, Nvidia supposedly released a driver on  My cynical nature tells me, they've done next to no testing on this driver on that particular "supported" hardware.
Now I take the stance, it ain't broke, don't fix it, even with graphics drivers. Thank goodness I don't bother with current "AAA" games anymore. LoneWolf15 Gerbil Elite. Wed Feb 06, pm If I can't find a driver on my own, it ain't worth findin'. Thu Feb 07, am Near the end of TR's own system build guide , after OS installation, the recommendation is to hunt down all drivers manually, starting with chipset drivers. Then all the other dedicated parts. Would you also recommend that?
Or is it enough to Trust Windows 8 to take care of this for me? Thu Feb 07, am I would only worry about drivers that aren't auto detected. Windows 8 does a pretty bang up job of detecting and installing anything older than it is, which is pretty much everything so far.
JohnC Gerbil Jedi. Thu Feb 07, am Yea The only stand-alone driver I always manually download is video card driver since I play games and want to know what changes new driver contains and whether it's worth getting it at all. Gifter of Nvidia Titans and countless Twitch donation extraordinaire, nothing makes me more happy in life than randomly helping random people.
Driver Genius Professional is a professional Driver management tool features both driver management and hardware diagnostics. If you often reinstall your operating system, you may not forget such painful experiences of searching all around for all kinds of drivers.
If unfortunately you have lost your Driver CD, the search will be more troublesome and time-consuming. Now with the Driver backup function of Driver Genius, you can backup all drivers in your computer before reinstalling, and restore them with the Driver restoration function after system reinstallation has been completed.
This will dramatically save your time for Driver installation during the system installation procedure, and you will no longer worry about where to find a Driver.
Besides, you can create an automatic installation package for all drivers in your system by Driver Genius. Discussion Topic.
