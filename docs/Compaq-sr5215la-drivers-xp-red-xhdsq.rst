Este fin de semana me toco darle mantenimiento completo a una computadora Compaq Presario SRLA la cual tiene como Sistema Operativo de fabrica Windows Vista Home Basic ya se hablo de que este sistema es realmente malo y no hay persona que diga lo contrario, asi que le recomende a mi cliente cambiar de S. Para esta computadora fue mas facil buscar los controladores ya que contenia una tarjeta madre ECS MCP61PM-HM ya sabiendo que tipo de tarjeta era solo basto con investigar que el Chipset, Video, Ethernet y Audio que tenia esta tarjeta madre, a continuacion les dejo todos los controladores para esta computadora para Windows Xp.
