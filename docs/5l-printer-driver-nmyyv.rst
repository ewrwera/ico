The LaserJet 5Si comes without a network adaptor, but an expansion slot is provided, and the firmware supports network printing. If an added network card can not be enabled, reset the printer to default factory settings - to do this, power off the printer, press and hold the online button and switch on the printer. Allow the printer to fully boot, then release the button. The printer is now reset to factory defaults, and the network configuration should now work.
Hope this works for you. We purchased our first three Windows 10 laptops in and early  During the process of adding this LaserJet 5n, the driver was not listed as an option when I went to install Windows  I recently purchased another 4th HP laptop and went through the same installation procedure.
At the point when I selected HP Laser 5N from the updated list of printers, it would not install the driver. I contacted both HP and Microsoft There English was pretty god , and after days of continually trying everything they recommended, I was told that the "HP LaserJet 5N" was no longer supported and that there is no work around. So I took the 4th laptop cak to Costco, where we purchased it.
This laptop was an x model, which has the screen flip around to the rear of the laptop and becomes a Windows 10 laptop. Since the first 3 laptops continue to work perfectly on the network, thinking that maybe HP added some drivers or software for the flip screen that maybe was conflicting with the HP LaserJet 5N, I then purchased an simple, entry HP laptop from Costco yesterday.
I ran into similar failures on this laptop The only thing that I could think of today was that recent Windows uprades in the last few months must be using upgraded drivers that do not support older HP lasers using PCL. So I went searching the Internet for the old universal driver. The driver file is "upd-pcl5-x I found a site that didn't charge, but did plant a cookie I can't guarantee that it will work for you, but I suspect that it will work for several PCL printers "no longer supported".
Maybe prompting buers to replace a perfectly good workhorse with a much less reliable laser printer? But it must be costing the various manufacturers that are "refurbishing" returns like the x I took back yesterday! Didn't find what you were looking for? Ask the community.
