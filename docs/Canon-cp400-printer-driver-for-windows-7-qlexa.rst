Although it's not an inkjet printer, I hope someone can help me out. The PC doesn't recognize the device as a printer. I've been looking on the net for a Win7 driver but with no success. If anyone can help me with a pointer to a driver or some sort of trick to get the CP working with Win7 I would really appreciate it.
Thank you. It looks like the newest driver available is for Windows Vista. You could try this driver, possibly installing it in compatibility mode for Windows Vista. I guess the install procedure is the same as for other Canon printer drivers: The printer must not be connected to the computer before you are told to do so by the install program.
