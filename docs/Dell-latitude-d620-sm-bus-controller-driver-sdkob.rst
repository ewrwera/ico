Is there anything else I am missing? I think I installed most of the important stuff, but obviously I missed 1 or 2 things. I guess if I go to use one of the ports or smart card readers in a few months and it doesn't work, I'll know I missed something.
Audio and video works. I'm thinking the problem was that the chipset driver needed to be installed first. Anyway, good to hear you're up and running. Publisher: dell.
