The ethernet controller is not recognised. I can access the internet but the network is a problem as the desktop acts as a server for the laptop.
Has anyone any solution other than waiting until Microsoft gets round to including drivers? In the meantime I have reverted to XP which is significantly better that Vista although nowhere near as good as 7.

Comments: There's a reason it's at the low end of the price spectrum. After setting up the system, and everything else working fine; I spent a few hours playing in the bios, changing drivers, and poking the sound jacks with a stick.
The system sees the device, and reports it working correctly, but no sound. Windows 11 Support Center. HP Support Solutions is downloading.
