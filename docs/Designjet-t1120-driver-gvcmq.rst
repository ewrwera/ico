For example, some software applications assume standard printable areas that are larger than those used in this printer. If you have defined a custom page size with very narrow margins, the printer may impose its own minimal margins, clipping your image slightly. You may want to consider using a larger paper size, or borderless printing see Select margins options. If your image contains its own margins, you may be able to print it successfully by using the Clip Contents by Margins option see Select margins options.
If you are trying to print a very long image on a roll, check that your software is capable of printing an image of that size. You may have asked to rotate the page from portrait to landscape on a paper size that is not wide enough. If necessary, reduce the size of the image or document in your software application, so it fits between the margins. There is another possible explanation for a clipped image. Some applications, such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and CorelDRAW, use an internal bit coordinate system which means that they cannot handle an image of more than 32, pixels.
If you try to print an image larger than this from these applications, the bottom of the image will be clipped. In this case, the only way to print the whole image is to reduce the resolution so that the whole image requires fewer than 32, pixels. Compatibility , which can be used to reduce the resolution of such images automatically. Some objects are missing from the printed image Large quantities of data may be necessary to print a high-quality large-format print job, and in some specific workflows there may be issues that can lead to some objects missing from the output.
In the Advanced tab, select Document options , Printer features , and set bit App. Compatibility to Enabled. In the Advanced tab, select Document options , Printer features , and set Max. Application resolution to  The above settings are mentioned for troubleshooting purposes and may adversely affect the final output quality or the time necessary to generate the print job.
Therefore, they should be restored to their default values if they do not help to solve the problem. Instead, you could try reducing the resolution of bitmap images in your application software. In order to avoid such problems, upgrade your Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader software to the latest version.
From version 7 onwards, these problems should be solved. It helps you to check the performance of the printheads that are currently installed in your printer, and whether any printhead suffers from clogging or other problems. Use the same paper type that you were using when you detected a problem. Use the View loaded paper key on the front panel to check that the selected paper type is the same as the paper type loaded into the printer.
At the printer's front panel, select the Image Quality Maintenance menu icon , then Print diagnostic image. Part 1 top consists of rectangles of pure colors, one for each printhead. This part represents the print quality that you will get from each color.
Part 2 bottom consists of small dashes, one for each nozzle on each printhead. This part complements the first, and aims more specifically to detect how many faulty nozzles each printhead has. Please look carefully at the print. The names of the colors are shown above the rectangles and in the center of the patterns of dashes. Figure : Image Diagnostics Print. First look at the upper part of the print part 1. Each colored rectangle should be a uniform color without any horizontal lines across it.
Then look at the bottom part of the print part 2. For each individual colored pattern, check that most of the dashes are present. If you see horizontal lines in part 1 and also missing dashes in part 2 for the same color, the printhead responsible needs cleaning.
However, if the rectangles look solid, do not worry about just a few missing dashes in part 2; these are acceptable because the printer can compensate for a few clogged nozzles. Figure : Gray printhead sample good.
Figure : Gray printhead sample bad. Corrective action Clean any faulty printheads see Clean the printheads. Then reprint the Image Diagnostics Print to see whether the problem has been solved. If the problem remains, clean the printheads again, and reprint the Image Diagnostics Print to see whether the problem has been solved. If the problem remains, consider cleaning your printheads manually see Clean the printheads. You could also try reprinting your current print job, in case it now prints satisfactorily.
If the problem remains, try cleaning the printhead drop detector. The printer normally notifies you when this is necessary, but it may be worth trying even if the printer has not suggested it. See Clean the printhead drop detector. If the problem still remains, replace any persistently faulty printheads see Handling ink cartridges and printheads , or contact HP Support see Contact HP Support. If you still have a problem If you still experience print-quality problems after applying the advice in this chapter, here are some further things that you can do:.
Try using a higher print-quality option. Check the driver you are using to print with. If it is a non-HP driver, consult the driver vendor about the problem. You could also try using the correct HP driver, if feasible. See the documentation that came with the RIP. We were unable to find any drivers for your product.
