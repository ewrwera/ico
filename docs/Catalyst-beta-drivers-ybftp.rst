From what i read about the skyrim crossfire profile is that it is godawfully buggy. CAP2 had generally good performance though so these issues are probably no longer there but you get what i mean For most people, the only way to run skyrim on crossfire was to disable it.
I had s or s in CF at that time and even though i did play skyrim for a bit, CF just never worked for me. I am using 3x x's CF on 3x 4k monitors in eyefinity. I really need to find time this weekend to test out my games and do a more accurate comparison.
Also, I will go through all my installed games and see how this new driver performs across the range. Benchmarking across the range too. So far, I am impressed.
