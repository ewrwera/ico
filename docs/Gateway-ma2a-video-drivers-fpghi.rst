I realize most of these posts are from quite a few years ago but I recently had a friend with a MX that seemed to have inverter issues. Of course I thought, 5. He was going to use an external monitor anyway. I ended up with an inverter that had bent pins or I bent them I was careful but one never knows. In playing one too many times, a few of the small wires on the LCD cable broke.. So then I thought OK I will order an inverter with cable — cheap — but then I realized that the cable attaches in a small area near the left hinge that looks like the whole top of the laptop would need to be separated to access.
I was wondering if you could verify as to how I would access that area. Dorothy, I think you are correct. This laptop is a little bit different than one shown in my guide but the disassembly procedure should be pretty similar.
After that you should be able to rout the display cable correctly. So I would have to do all 1 through 16 steps to get the top off? Dorothy, You are correct. HI again. Well I got lucky. I kept looking at the replacement part and it made no sense I would have to disassemble the whole thing. It is different in that the small piece that I thought had the wires jack into it was actually a block that just lifted up from its board on the mx Had I sent a picture, I am sure you would have told me that..
So no major work was required.. I was not up to a total 16 steps as I was sure something else might go wrong. I hope when the part arrives, it works. But no matter what, I just wanted the chance to know one way or the other. Thank you very much, could not have repaired the unit without your detailed instructions.
