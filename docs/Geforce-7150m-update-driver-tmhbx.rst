I am so incredibly disappointed that HP hasn't done it. I get a sneaky suspicion they won't because my computer is not new enough. I ran into the exact same problem. I tried downloading the driver from NVidia, with the same results. NVidia support pointed me here. I hightly doubt they will support system once they are out of production beyond what the HP driver sites listes.
Just image how many old system they would have to support? Someone will have to pay for that work. There will come a time when some system can't use Windows 10 and we should come to that realization as well. If HP have made changes to a standard offering then they should support the changes or warn buyers they have built in obsolesense.
On the listing it says it supports only Vista yet I'm running Windows 7. I was able to find a temporary fix until they hopefully release an updated driver for windows  Make sure the search subdirectories check box is checked. I was able to instal it using the 64 bit version but I assume it will work for the other version too as long as it is the correct one for your system.
Not to get on too high a soapbox, but o thers on the forum here make the point that HP can't support their hardware forver, and I understand and agree with that. On the other hand, the drivers are for the chipset, they don't need to make a driver for each individual PC model. And NVidia already has Windows 10 reference drivers developed that work with this chipset. I imagine there are millions of these PCs still in use.
Thanks so much for finding this! Thank you msddjd, your solution also helped me and now graphics look proper like they're supposed to.
Normally running the driver in compatibility mode works just fine even going all the way back to Vista but in this case that did not work. Your solution however did. Thanks again.
