Buy a can of compressed air and blow it into the fan grill on the bottom and side of the laptop. Cleaning the cooling module might fix the problem. Thanks a lot for this guide, very very usefull for my gateway mx I have an issue with the cooling fan. This issue begins yesterday when I pull out the memory modules to put in another laptop for testing purpose.
I change the memories carefully with an antistatic strip cable. How can I active back the cooling fan. The rare thing is that I turn on the laptop for 5 hrs with the fan not working and the laptop not shut down or freeze for overheating, simply not overheating. How can u explain that??? Please any comments, help , suggestion, repair, diagnostic will be appreciate.
Let me know if you know something about. Thanks a lot. I realize most of these posts are from quite a few years ago but I recently had a friend with a MX that seemed to have inverter issues.
Of course I thought, 5. He was going to use an external monitor anyway. I ended up with an inverter that had bent pins or I bent them I was careful but one never knows. In playing one too many times, a few of the small wires on the LCD cable broke.. So then I thought OK I will order an inverter with cable — cheap — but then I realized that the cable attaches in a small area near the left hinge that looks like the whole top of the laptop would need to be separated to access.
I was wondering if you could verify as to how I would access that area. Dorothy, I think you are correct. This laptop is a little bit different than one shown in my guide but the disassembly procedure should be pretty similar. After that you should be able to rout the display cable correctly.
So I would have to do all 1 through 16 steps to get the top off? Dorothy, You are correct. HI again. Well I got lucky. I kept looking at the replacement part and it made no sense I would have to disassemble the whole thing.
It is different in that the small piece that I thought had the wires jack into it was actually a block that just lifted up from its board on the mx Driver gateway-ne56r10u-drivers gateway-nvdrivers gateway-nv57h50u gateway-nv57h77u-drivers gateway-p5ws5-drivers gateway-ta7-drivers gateway-wireless-keyboard gateway-ze7 gcn-motherboard-drivers gcc-plotter-drivers-windows-7 gcexpress gdm gdr-h10nblk ge gear-head-driver gear-head-mouse.
