At a certain point, the installation process would ask me to reconnect the USB cable and then click the "OK" or "Continue" button in the installion dialog box. However, I noticed that as soon as I connected the USB cable but before I could click the button, Windows would automatically start installing a driver.
It would always do the same thing. It would install 6 or 7 components, 4 or 5 would successfully install regarding printing. A separate status dialog box would pop up showing these parts installed. A green check mark would appear next to the print functions. However, 2 components dealing with scanning would not successfully install.
These components would get a red X next to them. Meanwhile, I would have clicked the "OK" or "Continue" button in the installion dialog box. After a few minutes, the installation would abort itself and I would end up having to uninstall the driver and reboot all over again. It finally dawned on me that 2 separate installations were going on at the same time. What finally resolved the problem was after uninstalling the driver and restarting yet again, I started the original installation application process but when I was prompted to connect the USB cable, I first disconnected the computer from the internet and then connected the USB cable.
Before I could click the "Continue" button, I noticed the separate installation process was beginning again. I immediately clicked the X in that dialog box to stop that installation.
I then clicked "Continue" on the desired installation dialog box and it finally successsfully installed. Once it installed, I reconnected the computer to the internet and the scanner now worked.

However, you can scan if you have the HP download from or earlier. The following driver that I downloaded in works scans with Windows 7 64 bit. I uploaded the driver to my ADrive accoung.
My settings were 8. This is hilarious! The computer I am using it on is NOT connected to the internet! So this is not the result of any program updates. This worked. I did not get the concurrent install, but disconnecting the internet was the key to success. My hard drive failed and so I had to replace it and then reinstall my OS Win 7 bit plus all my software and devices. Here is my solution: 1 From the Start button, click Devices and Printers. Click the Hardware tab.
