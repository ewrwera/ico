Another feature to note is the network feature that allows you to hook up and use the camcorder as a webcam. This feature works only with Windows XP and the supplied software.
Additionally, there are more capabilities within the supplied software package that help transfer and view pictures and video for both Windows and Mac systems. One of the more common Canon features is still with us in the Optura  The Mode Dial has the shutter priority and aperture priority settings along with a fully auto mode, program mode and five different AE modes including one for night shooting.
Additionally, if you choose the Special Scene mode there are six more modes that are specialized for foliage, snow, beach, sunset, spotlight and fireworks shooting conditions. Sound It Out Playing back our footage, the audio sounds full and rich on the Optura  The onboard mic has a decent range, picking up sound from 25 plus feet away. However, the onboard mic sits in the very front of the camcorder, just below the lens, where it unfortunately faces some issues. We did notice a little noise from the zoom motor, which is consistent with what we've seen and heard about the Optura 60 prior to our review.
But if you're planning on using an external mic, it won't be a problem and you can utilize the manual audio level control to really fine tune the audio. Using the select wheel you can gain up or down the right and left channel together.
Unfortunately, there's no way to control each channel independently. In playback, the Optura 60 has the option to isolate either the right r left channel, in addition to its normal stereo playback. There's also an attenuator built-in to help pad line level input to the mic jack.
Overall, the audio features are quite rich and useful for advanced shooters with plenty of options for semi-professional audio capturing. Stunning Shots The video playback is delightfully detailed and very nice in color. The color reproduction looks vibrant and true to life.
