If the configuration or operation of a bus differs significantly from other buses, the bus driver for the bus should use a unique enumerator name to ensure that the child devices of the bus are not unintentionally and inappropriately grouped with child devices that are enumerated by the bus drivers for these other buses.
The bus driver should use the following format to report device identification strings to the PnP manager:. For examples of actual device identification strings, see Device Identification Strings. A device ID is the hardware ID that is the most specific description of a device. In the following example, the device ID specifies the vendor, the device, the subsystem, and the revision.
A hardware ID list specifies IDs in order, from the most specific to the least specific. In the following list, a device identification string is reported as hardware ID if it specifies at least the vendor, the device, and the subsystem. The hardware ID that includes the most information is listed first.
In the following list, a device identification string is reported as compatible ID if it specifies at least the vendor and device positions 1 and 2 , but does not specify the subsystem position 3.
Privacy policy. In most cases, a device has more than one hardware ID associated with it. Typically, a list of hardware IDs is sorted from most to least suitable for a device. Typically, when you create a new hardware ID for your device, you'll use one of the following generic formats:. This is the most common format for individual PnP devices reported to the Plug and Play PnP manager by a single enumerator. For more information, see Generic Identifiers.
You can prevent this by using a unique namespace for each driver that has a root enumerated device. Then, before installing, check to see if the devnode is already present. Open pcidatabase. From the vendor ID search, you will see the device manufacturer and its information.
From the device search, you will see the device type. So this is a solution about using hardware ID to find drivers for a device. If you cannot find the unknown devices with the hardware ID, you can try to update the unknown devices automatically.
Some people reported that even through using the hardware ID to find it from pcidatabase. So how to find these device drivers? Here you can use Driver Booster to help you. It is a driver tool which can find all the missing, outdated and faulty drivers.
As a powerful driver tool, it can help users to get the latest graphic driver, audio driver, USB driver, mouse driver, keyboard driver, etc with one click. Download , install and run it on your computer. Click Scan. After that, it will show you how many drivers are missing, how many drivers are outdated and how many drivers are up-to-date. And if there is one or more driver is faulty, it also shows to you.
