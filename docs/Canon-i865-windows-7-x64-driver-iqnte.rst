Amazingly FAST. Rendering a highest quality model on my old core 2 duo would take nearly 1 hour. With the 64 bit OS on i7 with 3Gb ram and same graphics card, same rendering would take just over 1 minute!!!
Cannot find 64 bit printer drivers for 2 of my 3 Canon printers. Have obviously checked Canon website but could not locate what I need and Canon do not appear to have a help service. Might be there somewhere but couldn't find it.
Without printer drivers the 64 bit system is useless. Even some v old applications. I expected the opposite that drivers etc would be no problem since we're told the world is about to go 64 bit soon.
Has anyone out there had dealings or problems with printer drivers for 64 bit Windows? Any help appreciated coz I'd love to go 64 bit. Antec Solo case. Purchased new copy of XP Home but currently experimenting with Windows 7 and will definitely upgrade to Windows 7 when its out. Lcars Desktop Windows 10 ».
