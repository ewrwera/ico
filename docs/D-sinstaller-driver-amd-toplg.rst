This prevents a possible automatic reboot of the operating system and the installation of a new driver package before the system boots. This step is considered optional. Since there are all the files necessary for downloading. A network connection is required to do the following:. Getting started with the installation of graphics drivers.
Double-click on the AMD driver installation file. The installation files are extracted to the created AMD folder, which was previously deleted by us. The user can choose another place, if desired, but this directory is selected by default. The program extracts the installation files to the folder indicated in the screenshot above.
The execution time depends on the performance of the operating system and hardware. When all the files are extracted, the program offers to install the driver files. You will need to accept the conditions of the page, as in the screenshot below, before proceeding with the installation. The software will scan the system to calculate the location for the GPUs.
It all depends on the speed of the system. When the installation is completed, the image will appear on the screen as in the screenshot below. Or opt for a custom installation, where you yourself will need to select components for a personal installation.
The most commonly chosen custom installation. Users prefer Wattman drams, GPU control. There are those who opt for third-party programs: Wattool, or Afterburner. It happens that the preservation of AMD Wattman causes a conflict, you need to remove it. When the files are installed, the program will prompt you to restart the PC.
To correctly complete the process of installing the driver, before restarting the PC, run the previously downloaded pixel patcher. This software is used to prevent problems associated with editing DAG files. Keep in mind the fact that if you did not change the default settings for the video card in the BIOS, then you can not use the pixel patcher at all and restart the computer immediately after installing the Blockchain Driver.
Getting started testing. We extract the contents of the previously downloaded patcher archive to the desktop or to a separate directory. As a result, the program will start. If you want to get test results without performing a signature check, then just rename the program launch file so that it looks like the screenshot shows. This is done to correct the BIOS signature verification and to ignore additional parameters.
When the pixel patcher is implemented, you can safely restart the computer. Testing ATI Drivers is not much different from testing similar software from other developers. When the computer restarts, do a quick check, to do this, start the device manager click on the Windows icon and select the device manager in the menu that opens.
It is important that the video cards connected to the PC are displayed, and the operating system does not issue any warnings. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of these licenses, you do not have a license to any of the AMD software provided by this download.

Again, Ubuntu does not come up. Improve this question. Googlebot Googlebot 1, 8 8 gold badges 28 28 silver badges 51 51 bronze badges. Add a comment. Active Oldest Votes. Improve this answer. Guser Guser 1 1 silver badge 3 3 bronze badges.
I got also the same problem, and those commands helped me: sudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg-video-radeon xserver-xorg-core sudo apt install xserver-xorg sudo update-initramfs -u -k all.

Also suggesting that we should only be looking at amdgpu-pro files is not appropriate as we have no knowledge what amdgpu-pro-uninstall did. We need to first remove the corresponding drivers, and then reinstall them to avoid future issues.
