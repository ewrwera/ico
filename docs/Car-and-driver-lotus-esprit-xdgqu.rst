Factory-legal exotics were great to look at one reasonably exciting to drive, but they just didn't take your breath away. Colin Chapman was just the man to put an end to that sorry state of affairs. The original Esprit appeared in , and people said: Right, lovely to look at, nice to drive, modestly quick, a few problems here and there.
Chapman, just as he had with all of Lotus's previous cars, began beavering away at the Esprit to make it better, faster, more complete. The car, in fact, had room allotted in its engine bay for a V-8, Chapman fantasizing among Lotus's Formula 1 trophies and World Championships that grafting two of his fine four-cylinders together would be a dandy thing to do.
But eventually turbocharging got the nod, and with it came major changes to the Esprit to strengthen it, to make it more livable, and to turn it into a more practical car. The Esprit Turbo was quickly acknowledged as one of the fastest cars in the world, the flag-waving British press in particular ballyhooing Chapman's latest work as if they'd been at God's elbow for the Second Coming.
Unfortunately, when Chapman died shortly before Christmas last year, Lotus was in shaky financial health, the ink was barely dry on its American marketing plan, and the Esprit Turbo was only halfway through the federalization process. Now, nearly a year later, that's all changed. Chapman's right-hand men banded together, borrowed financial support from American Express, which should soon be paid off, sold sixteen percent of the company to Toyota, for whom considerable development work has already been done, and signed a new and more clearly conceived marketing plan for the United States.
If you are something, you will know that BRG stands for British racing green, a hue most closely associated with Lotus's racing cars—notably the classic models 25 and  It was the mid-engined 38 that won the Indy with Scotsman Jim Clark aboard. With this limited-edition Esprit, Lotus commemorates its win at lndy 27 years ago. That the car is intended to mark the 25th anniversary of the victory is, well, British eccentricity. And, what the heck. Lotus imported exactly zero models, and no one so much as bleated, so who's counting?
No matter what, this Lotus is genuine, God-save-the-Queen British racing green—a tint that is lighter, more yellowish, and how to say this delicately? In addition to the provocative paint, the Jim Clark package include a cockpit awash in gold Connolly leather with green piping.
That wheel is red. Hey, you want logic, buy a Honda. Unlike a previous Esprit we tested, this one features as standard equipment a driver-side air bag in a steering wheel lifted from a Pontiac Bonneville the only clue that GM has clout in Hethel , as well as anti-lock brakes and a three-year unlimited-mileage warranty.
Which may allay fears about the Esprit's spotty mechanical record. Like the country from which it emanates, this automobile tends to be cranky, crusty, quirky, and occasionally hilarious. It is the world's only supercar with a four-cylinder engine, for example—and a rough one, at that.
This 2. Like Roberto Guerrero on the pace lap. We're talking serious specific output here: two horsepower per cubic inch. If a Corvette ZR-1 's engine were similarly tweaked, it would produce horsepower. At full trot between and rpm, the pound Esprit feels as if it were loaded with a V-8 gulping a cubic yard or two of nitrous. Was he a clumsy gentleman racer? The exhaust manifold and turbo handle a great deal of heat, so watch for loose bolts. The pump that circulates liquid through the intercooler has an impeller that was hardly intended to handle the heat of a turbocharged car.
While the impeller can be replaced, the recommended repair is replacing the entire pump with a more reliable electric unit. JW: Never jump-start an Esprit. Always use the coolant called for by the factory. Just to give all you tall drivers out there some hope. Simon Pritchard is 6ft 7inch and weighs in at 22 stone yet after fitting some skinny seats in his Turbo Esprit, he finds it comfortable to drive.
See his owners page here. Profiled trainers have a specially shaped sole and are contoured to the foot, therefore there is no sole overlap and no danger of catching them on other pedals, mine are made by puma and took a while to find. I only drive wearing these shoes". There are modifications that can be made to maximise the space in the Esprit cabin and make it more comfortable for larger drivers.
This is a short guide of what can be done to fit 6ft 5" drivers into the cockpit and make those a little smaller, a little more comfortable. The main problem tall drivers have, is lack of room for their knees. The steering wheel it un-adjustable and larger drivers find the wheel almost in their lap with their legs push out either side. There are a few things that can easily be done to help increase the space.
This will create more leg room. The other problem is of course headroom.
