At startup of your system the setup scripts go through the configuration files for the network interfaces. The network interfaces are brought up in the order they are listed. The named network interface is activated as soon as the network cable is plugged in, and deactivated as soon as the the network cable is unplugged.
In order to communicate with other computers in a network an interface is assigned an IP address. This address is obtained either dynamically via DHCP or set in a fixed way static configuration. After the interface declaration you are invited to specify a number of options option name in brackets.
This includes values such as the IP address address , the netmask netmask , the broadcast range broadcast , the routing metric for the default gateway metric , the default gateway gateway , the address of the other end point pointtopoint , the link local address hwaddress , the packet size mtu as well as the address validity scope scope.
Connecting to different networks requires flexibility. Similar to the static configuration from above a number of options are possible to be set. These options depend on your DHCP setup.
Try: lspci -nn to get further info too. Delete the one with eth0. Change eth1 to eth0 As root issue the command udevadm trigger or simply reboot. The problem is cause that your old hard disk assigned eth0 to the old NIC. Now you have moved the hard disk, it found a new NIC and udev called it eth1.
You will find exactly the same when you replace the NIC. Originally Posted by j1alu. Last edited by PoleStar; at PM. What is the result of Code:. Originally Posted by jlinkels. Thread Tools. BB code is On.

Improve this answer. The VPN interface always seems to take precedence, but I don't know why. I only want it to be used in very rare circumstances I want the application that uses it to have to specify the VPN interface. Any ideas?

I booted my box with the grub config modifications and I am still getting eth1 as the default device in many apps. I checked the dmesg for network info and and it says that the integrated NIC has still ' eth1 ' as ifname: forcedeth  This is not too serious problem but it really grinds my gears because the integrated is 1gb card and it should be the default device.
I have now tried to use nameif to change the network interface names but looks like it does the same that udev does. No change in "real" NIC order. Any fresh ideas? LawrenceC LawrenceC  They just use the first device they find and totally ignores the interface names.
I can see why it is done like that, its much easier to use the first found device than sort the names. Gilles 'SO- stop being evil' Gilles 'SO- stop being evil' k gold badges silver badges bronze badges.
Perhaps I just leave it for now. Luckily some apps really checks the interface name. On the other hand some apps doesnt even have default configuration options so I just have to use -i option.
I thought it should be possible to change the NIC order at kernel startup. Your interfaces probably use different drivers, so you'd have to arrange for the drivers to be loaded in the order you want. I would expect this to be difficult, especially if you want your tweak to work across a kernel upgrade.
If they have different drivers, at least back in the day you could put into one of the module configuration files: alias eth0 driver1 alias eth1 driver2 That's some pretty old knowledge but it may help.
