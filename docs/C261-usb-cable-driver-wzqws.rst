Yesterday, I took the bike for a ride and could not use the third gear because of the slipping. I tried the throttle going up a relatively steep hill and could hear and feel like the hub gears were slipping.
I have a feeling that the issue has nothing to do with the motor and is being caused by a problem with the gears in my Sturmey-Archer internal hub. That would be really unfortunate for you, but it could be possible.
If that is the case, be careful with deciding what the replacement should be. Unfortunately, there was an issue with the download links, this has been resolved now. Thanks for letting me know. The second statement is sort of correct, in theory, you can do this. In order to make use of all the power that the BBSHD has to offer though some other settings can be increased as well. Such as start current and slow start. So you can absolutely only change the current limit and have the same recommended settings for the BBSHD.
Unusual problem. Only in first gear when applying throttle the engine cuts out until applying more throttle, then cuts out again, until max throttle is applied.
Is this a controller programing issue or possibly a battery pack issue. Battery is 5 years old but seems normal, issue only started after replacing old burnt out controller with a new Luna controller. Maybe I need to adjust something in the programing?
It is interesting that it only started after the controller swap. Can you still read the old controller? In that case you can transfer the exact same settings.
If that would be the problem, the display would cut out as well. Next to that, the problem should also be present before the controller swap in that case. But getting the exact same settings on there as the old controller is definitely something that you should try first. Hello and thanks for the info on programming!
I just got a Biktrix Stunner and the throttle is not like my old RadCity rear direct drive. Any way to increase the throttle to max on all PAS but keep it variable? Do you mean setting it to speed gives you a more controlled range on the throttle? The window cannot be maximized. Am I crazy? Is something corrupted? Please help! I have never heard of this issue before.
Are you using a 4K monitor? If not, still try a different monitor resolution, this might fix the window issue you have. I however have never heard nor experienced such an issue. Thanks for your reply.
I really want to make these improvements to my bike! Maybe somebody know the answer to my problem. I have a bafang w mid drive motor and sometimes the motor dosent stops after i stop pedaling. Its stops only when i use the brakes to stop the motor. Did anyone had the same issue or any advice?
You should check the settings: start degree and stop delay. Check if these settings are set to my recommended values. If not, try to change them to these values. This might fix your issue. Will it be ok to use the settings you provide or should i change anything else in the settings or reduce any of the settings? Yes you can use the settings that are provided. The max current for the Bafang Ultra is 30A. So do make sure the current limit is set to 30A.
Also make sure that the cut-off voltage is set to 41V if you are running a 48V battery. The Bafang ultra is really powerful, you therefore might want to increase some settings, to get more power. The settings that I recommend could be a bit to conservative for the Bafang Ultra. Just test some settings, if you for example want more acceleration power, change the corresponding setting. All these settings are explained in my guide. You will be able to tune your bike exactly to your liking using this guide.
Thanks again for sharing, it really is much appreciated! You then should definitely set it to 26 inch. You should match it with your bike, otherwise the speed measurement will be incorrect.
So yes, definitely change this. Doing it now, will be interesting to see if i notice a sizeable difference in the reading. My programming cable will be here Thursday so you will probably be sick of silly questions from me by Thursday evening. Lol As always, thank you very much for your help my friend. There may be a lot of that back and forth till i get it right. LOL It seems the Ultra can really be tuned quite a bit more than what it comes from the factory.
Have you tuned an Ultra yourself before? You can indeed find a lot of information on the internet. Good luck with programming your Ultra. You should be able to get a lot more power out of the Ultra if the stock settings were conservative.
What the stock settings were does depend on where you bought it. But if they were set conservative, it will really make a big difference. So i ventured into the programming today. It seems the max speed is the only thing they have been a bit restrictive with 40kmph. I need to really go through it but it seems they have these well set up out the box.
You should set this to match the wheel size of your bike. This is how the controller calculates speed. My questions are pretty basic. I notice a lot of motor drag when trying to pedal without power…is that normal?
I would like to ride without power on level ground but there is too much drag. Is there any remedy? Second question. Having more drag on an e-bike is normal. In addition to spinning the wheel, you will also be spinning the motor. This therefore increases the amount of friction, which results in the feeling of more drag. This is absolutely normal.
This way the motor can overcome its own friction. Your own power can than all be used to propel the bike. This way it will feel more like a normal non-electric bike. The battery percentage indicator tends to be a bit inaccurate on the Bafang displays.
When the battery is at a low percentage, the voltage is low. If the voltage drops beneath a certain threshold, the assistance will stop.
This is a safety feature designed to keep the battery in good health. For a 48V battery, a low voltage cut-off of 41V is appropriate. You could set the battery indicator to voltage instead. This way you can make your own judgement about the battery percentage.
Which often is more accurate than the display does. If it is at around 42V, it will be nearly completely empty. Hi, Thanks for all the effort you put forth to help everyone. Is this the factory setting? Regards, Frank. Having max throttle power in all PAS levels is definitely something that you can do with the programming software. So this is the desired behavior. To increase the power of the initial throttle push, you can increase the start current.
Thank you for the very comprehensive reply. This is a big deal to me because of all the very steep but short hills where I ride. Now I will be able to climb the hills with just a proper gear selection and a short burst of throttle power…. Hi Frank, have you adjusted the settings and if so how did you go?
Hoi Giel, Ik heb een watt bbs02 met een dpc18 display op een 48 volt akku. Fiets net klaar, en nu wil ik alles een beetje gaan fine tunen. Mijn display heeft 5 ondersteunings niveaus, en een eco en sport mode. Ik zou graag de eco mode gebruiken om een road legal setting te maken, en de sport mode om een speed setting te creeren.
Ik kan deze eco en sport mode helemaal niet terugvinden in de configuratietool op mn laptop. Weet jij waar ik deze modes kan configureren? Alvast bedankt, Luc.
De eco en sport modes zijn niet te configureren. Zover ik weet, zijn ze zelfs exact hetzelfde op een Bafang systeem. Daarom is het een vrij nutteloze feature van het display.
Dank je Giel voor het snelle antwoord. Als ik het eggrider v2 display aanschaf, kan ik dan wel die 2 modes configureren? Nee, dan is deze nog steeds niet te configureren. De configuratie zit in de firmware van het display.
Daarom kan het niet door consumenten veranderd worden. The throttle settings are set as per this article. From a stop I find the throttle to be lacking. I want the throttle to take off quickly. Needed for crossing busy streets. If you want the throttle to give more power and react more aggressive from the start you should adjust the following setting:. You can increase the start current in the throttle tab. The higher you set it, the more power it will give initially. You could snap a chain when you apply a lot of power in the wrong gear when accelerating from a standstill for example.
Controller damage can also occur when settings are to excessive. So you can definitely get more power out of your throttle, so that you can accelerate faster on busy streets. Increase the power with care though.
Only increase the settings in small steps and do intermediate test. Stop increasing when you feel that the power becomes to much for your bike to handle. If you do this with care, you will be fine! I like pedal a lot and use assist by motor using only by throttle? You could try to set strart degree to 0. You could unplug the PAS sensor, in order to disable it via hardware though.
Much thanks for advice I will try 1 option. I have some problems with my Bafang kw motor. I just bought it one week ago and battery show me wrong percentage on the screen.
So completely wrong. How to fix this problem? Do you have a 36V, 48V or 52V battery? Settings in your description above, and it is started to happen some days ago. Thank you for your help! You can try to reset to your default settings, and see if it still happens. There likely is something wrong with stop delay, stop decay or current decay setting.
So try default settings back-up that you likely made , upload and test again. If everything works you can try inserting custom settings again and see if it will work this time. Hi Dima, I am having the same problem.
In my case, I have 2 bikes with exactly the same material except the first is w and the second is w. The second bike shows a  When I change the batteries between the 2 bikes, now the first battery shows the wrong percentage on the second bike and the second battery is OK on the first bike! I know both batteries are full because the voltage reads  This tells me the problem is with the controller instead of the battery and display error.
Have you received any solutions? If the voltage of your battery is  A fully charged 48V battery would he  So if this is what the bike reads, it is correct. Thanks for your answer Giel. The bike will pedal like a normal push bike and when I use the throttle the motor starts.
Is your screen set to the correct battery voltage? You can select different voltages on most displays? This could be the problem, check this first, if this is set to 48V, measure the voltages and let me know. I put the same battery on his bike. In my opinion nothing wrong can be with battery.
My screen have always been set to 48V. If the battery voltage is  I would contact your seller about this, if this is the case. They might be able to send a replacement. Dit is normaal. Het batterij voltage of percentage is het enige wat is af te lezen.
I realize this is a strange one for sure. It definitely drops almost immediately like is related to a setting. I may need to call Bafang on this one.
I looked at the settings that you can change on your display. In that case, how do I make throttle zero on PAS 1? This will also disable the pedal assist in PAS 1 though. There is only one version of the controller you have. Therefore it unfortunately will be impossible to get a throttle working on your bike. Thanks Giel. When you say pas 9 for safety reasons are you saying its safer to ride at full power on pas 9 than full power with the throttle only?
No, I meant to say that when you turn on the bike, it will default to PAS 0 most of the time. If you then accidentally hit the throttle when you have powered on the bike, and are not on the bike, then it can shoot forward. This therefore can be unsafe. Therefore these kinds of things cannot happen. Thanks, John. I understand that this might be confusing. It is possible to get the throttle working in PAS 0. If you want this, you should set the current limit on PAS 0 to a value different then 0 depending on the power you want.
If you do this however, the pedal assist will also work. So it is not possible to have PAS 0 as a throttle only setting. I would just keep the current limit of PAS 0 on 0 however. This way you can have the bike on, without the risk of it applying power. This can be convenient if you show the bike to someone new for example. But if you would like to have throttle in PAS 0, change the current limit of that assist level in the Basic tab.
This way the throttle nor pedal assist will work on startup. Which is a safe thing to do. Hi Giel , I have a bafang bbshd. It has just been installed. The throttle isnt working when the pedal assist is set to zero. It is working on all other pedal assist levels , Pedal assist is also working. Any advice you have on why this is happening would be greatly appreciated. The level 0 is meant so that you can have the bike on, but without pedal assist or throttle. Thanks for you answer. I bought a bbshd about 7 months ago which i have on another bike.
With that one the throttle works when the pedal assist is set to zero. Is this a new setting in the motors. Can it be changed with the programming cable. When the pedal assist is set to on but i just use the throttle is that ok for the motor? Sorry I misunderstood your question. Yes you could. This will mean that your bike will give full power and full speed in PAS 0. Most of the time people prefer to have this on the highest setting PAS 9 because of safety reasons.
But in theory you could do this. I have just bought a bafang w mid drive motor with an c controller. I intended to use this on a touring bike. The main aim is to be able to carry a lot of work gear etc. So speed is not my priority. Range and torque are more important. I understand that the current will be set at 18 amps. So if I dial down the current to say 15 amps will I increase range but maintain torque?
Current and torque are directly related to eachother. A higher current will result in greater torque. The 18 amps is the maximum current, you will only hit this in the highest assist mode.
So if you just select a lower assist mode, your current wil be a certain percentage of the 18 amps 3 amps for example in assist mode 1. You just pedal along in the assist level that you find that gives enough assistance. That assistance will draw a certain amount of current, which will determine your range.
Can this motor be used with a different controller to give me use of a throttle? If so which controllers. This is the case with pretty much al ebikes, and especially for Bafang motors.
But external controllers are always possible, but this will be extremely DIY, and not convenient or clean at all. It will also require lots of modding and advanced knowledge. So this is not something I would recommend at all.
A user called Herve, has confirmed that he has reprogrammed his M though. He has responded in this comment section as well with some tips on this. No particular worries.
Pas de soucis particulier. Hi Giel, thanks for your fine work! What would you say to resetting the parameter for the wheel diameter in order to achieve a sort of cheap and simple speed hack? With the Bafang BBSxx motor kits, you can easily change the top speed. You can simply change the top speed on the display. Your speedometer will then still work like it should. Is my range normal? Very well explained programming settings.
A 17Ah or 13Ah will definitely not give the same range, at the same speeds. A 17Ah will likely give you 75km range at those speeds. A 13Ah battery, more like 50km. So I definitely think your range is normal. If you are happy with the way it rides, just keep those settings, other settings will not improve your range.

The difference between an adapter and a converter generally is that an adapter usually only adapts the physical interface of a device to match a different type of physical interface of a different device whereas a converter converts the actual data stream between two devices.
Therefore we will use the term "converter" in the following. Even the RS standard is an older communication protocol it is still used by many modern devices in both business and consumer markets and is also often used for personal and office devices. Actually many new devices designed today are designed with a RS serial port, often because RS is a very robust and reliable protocol which is fairly easy for program writes to integrate into their system.
Serial converters are used a lot in industrial applications as a way to communicate with factory machinery or to interface with test equipment, however in one particular area the serial converter has also become very useful for consumers who need a serial port in their personal computer.
Most new computers today does not have a RS COM port which makes the use of a USB to serial converter useful for connecting equipment such as serial printers, scanners, scales and GPS devices, but also many types of business, office and laboratory equipment.
