Thus, to turn the motor shaft continuously, the windings must be energized sequentially in continuous cycles. The basic pattern for energizing the windings in sequence is conveniently achieved by digital means, such as from the output port of a computer or from the digital outputs of a stepper motor controller IC.
These digital signals, however, are not strong enough to drive the windings of a stepper motor directly, so there's a need to 'amplify' the current capacity of these signals. The Stepper Motor is a Unipolar Type in 5 wire configuration. The center pin is shorted internally and is connected to the supply 12V here. The other 4 terminals of the stepper motor are the ends of two coils. They must be connected to the collector terminals of the four transistors. It important that they are connected in the sequence of firing of the outputs.
Finally, four diodes are connected between the collector terminals and supply. Diodes are very important as they will protect the transistors from inductive spiking.
The working of this Stepper Motor Driver circuit is very simple. We will see a step — by — step working explanation. Based on the position of the Potentiometer, the frequency of the square wave will vary anywhere between 7 Hz to Hz. For every positive transition of the clock signal i. For first positive transition on clock, Q0 will be high, for second positive transition, Q1 will be high and so on.
Since we need only 4 outputs, the fifth output i. Just provide sequence of pulse using Micro-Controller or descript circuit to roll out the unipolar motor. On board High Watt resistor to control the current, value of the resistor can be set as per your load current requirement. Thanks for sharing this project.
Very elegant and simple,this is what I was looking for! My only question is how big load I can connect which type of stepper motor max? As a maker who started more from an art background than engineer, I appreciate the way you discuss the subject. By Chein Eastern Geek Follow. More by the author:.
