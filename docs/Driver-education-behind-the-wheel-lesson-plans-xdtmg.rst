So, what can you expect from your first behind-the-wheel with an instructor? These lessons may begin and end at a Top Driver Education Center or at your home, if you live in one of our home pick-up service areas. Remember that students are required to have their Instructional Permit in their possession each and every time they operate a motor vehicle. Lesson plans are designed to be flexible based on the comfort and skill level of each student. Mail, fax or email a signed Service Agreement and classroom completion certificate to Safeway.
Mail check if paying by check. What we will do: Call you to arrange to get a Blue Card to you. We can mail it or it can be picked up at our office in Roseville. What you then need to do: Take the Knowledge permit Test. Wait for the hard-card photo permit to come in the mail from the State.
Register the permit number with Safeway. Schedule behind-the-wheel lessons. It's up to parents and teens to find opportunities for plenty of quality practice driving during the learner's permit period. This TeenDrivingPlan Practice Guide helps parents take action to ensure teens get the quality practice they need to become safe drivers. Organized by driving environment , the guide includes specific driving goals for each environment, as well as 54 short video tutorials. Ready to get started?
