HX is the over-ear headset built for lightweight comfort. Its large 9. Excellent Outputs. Its delicate layered system enhances acoustic performance with exquisite sound in an incredibly small space to bring you the best of the best. Sound Tunning: Diffuser. Compared to a reflective surface, a diffuser can reduce distinct echos and reverbs in mixed frequency for serving you the nice and clean sounds.
Diffuser in HX's Chamber. Irregular surface allows wave energy divides into smaller paths and generates harmonic resonances. Reflective Surface in Other's. The sound directly rebounding from the surface generates the echo. Crystal Clear Inputs. With HX, its large 9. The extended length of the pick-up unit can be adjusted for extra clarity and its anti-pop cover reduces sound disturbance.
The foldable microphone also provides extra flexibility for easy adjustment during play. Crosstalk Reduction. Furthermore, it's helped by the Mopar 3-speed automatic, a strong unit that can be easily controlled by the driver thanks to the precise, virtually dimwit-proof shifting mechanism.
Not so good on the Barracuda is the fact that the controls are of the super-low effort variety with the result that the driver sometimes feels removed from what the car is doing. It's too much in contrast to what the car ends up being—a demand on driver skill and interest. Also not so good was the Barracuda's braking. It stopped in relatively short distances, but it tended to be a handful to keep under control when the rear wheels locked up too soon. So the Barracuda's schizophrenia is Plymouth's schizophrenia in its attitude toward the sporty car concept.
The car asks a lot of the driver—most of the time—but makes things too bland for him when it doesn't. The styling is a visual departure from the sporty car theme—but it's appealing. If you like to drive, and drive hard, and know what you're about, you'll get the most out of this second rated of the sporty cars.
If you don't do any of those things, you're probably not a sporty car buyer anyway. Latest entrant in the sporty car sweepstakes, the Javelin, has the benefit of time working for it in its design.
It's a third-generation car. It also has the disadvantages of AMC's less-than-glamorous image, and AMC's previous track record in the enthusiast market to contend with. Our Javelin was the first ever built—but its long suit was its handling.
It felt very much like a British sports car—with the same advantages as well as the same disadvantages. The Javelin is nearly neutral when pushed through a hard corner and a controllable, power-induced over-steer can be obtained whenever desired. The car displayed a high degree of roll stiffness a function of the high spring and anti-sway bar rates which contributed to the driver's feeling of security and comfort even when the Javelin was all bent around itself in a turn.
On the tight handling course the SST was everyone's favorite because of its versatility and predictability. It was light and responsive and felt more at home being driven like a sports car than it did on the drag strip. The Javelin's styling was another area that received unanimous approval. It has a clean understated appearance that is not marred by phony vents, power bulges, mounds or bizarre sculpturing of whatever variety.
The Javelin is an honest-looking car with a dramatic flair. AMC hasn't had any time to play with the , at least officially, and so we didn't expect the car to tear up the pavement. We weren't disappointed. It didn't. It was the slowest in the quarter-mile  That didn't do much for us at a stop light or in traffic. When the go signal is given, and you open the throttle, things feel fine for a few instants.
Then, all of a sudden, your foot is right down on the wood—just when you figure all hell is about to break loose. The deception comes from the extremely short travel of the accelerator pedal; even short increments of pedal depression seem to produce large gains in acceleration, but the whole feeling doesn't last long enough to be really impressive.
While the engine represents a significant commitment by American Motors in the performance market, it would have been nice if they'd coupled it to something other than the Borg-Warner 3-speed automatic. The engineers at AMC have wrought a minor miracle in modifying this archaic transmission so that it is merely inconvenient instead of being an outright disappointment, but, compared to the other, modern 3-speeds, the B-W doesn't cut it. Manual shifting proved there are great lags on both up and downshifts and cruising through traffic at 40 mph is a truly confusing time for the transmission.
It's constantly upshifting and downshifting in the hope of finding some range where it will be happy. Inside the Javelin you will find an all-plastic world. Plastic has its virtues as a straightforward material genuine, imitation plastic? The only problem here is the plastic butts against itself and the metal body panels of the car, and every time the wheels hit a slight bump, there's a multitude of rattles and squeaks. So you may be distracted a little by the noise, but by God you can see.
The windshield is raked well back into the roof so it's easy to spot overhead traffic lights even if you're parked almost underneath them.
The seats are comfortable, more than that, they're unique: they have adjustable backrests so that anyone can find, or can vary, a comfortable seating position. But we have to call AMC sharply on the company's much ballyhooed and bragged about extra room for rear seat passengers. First off, it almost isn't there at all, and secondly, what kind of curious mentality would seize upon that as a virtue to publicize in a sporty car?
It might help you get your wife down to look at the car, but she'll try out the back seat and find out for herself that it isn't there. The biggest problem with the interior of the Javelin is the instrumentation. We can understand wanting to save money by going to all that plastic, and we can even live with the B-W automatic thanks to the precise and simple shift lever that AMC has designed, but if we're going to buy a sporty car we want to be kept abreast of what's going on under the hood and the Javelin doesn't do it.
The speedometer is set in a well that must be six inches deep and it is very hard to read; there are precious few worthwhile instruments idiot lights are in their stead and the tachometer is nearly unusable.
It's mounted in another well, like the speedometer, but off to the driver's left so that unless he drives with his left hand in his lap, there's no way to see the tiny instrument and its jumpy indicator needle. One clever and convenient idea that other manufacturers should copy, is installing the door locks inside the arm rests.
Most of the sporty cars have long doors which necessitate twisting around in the seat to push down the lock buttons. AMC's idea makes the whole process much easier. The Javelin, because of its handling, turned out to be the most fun to drive of any of the sporty cars.
But its performance was not spectacular and AMC is going to have to make it spectacular if they're going to do well in the enthusiast market. As with the Barracuda, there was some doubt whether the Cougar really belonged in this test of sporty cars. But if the Barracuda was suspect because of its humble origins and plain-jane exterior, the Cougar's problem was just the opposite. Mercury's entry in the market may be styled in the sporty car manner, but that's about it. It's sort of the Thunderbird of the sporty car world and it makes it clear that it's far more at home on the old Interstate than thrashing around back-country roads or running up and down drag strips.
Our Cougar test car may have suffered more than anyone knew from its dice out on the Ohio Turnpike. Some people from Mercury checked it out before turning it over to us and reported that everything was fine, and then we checked it out to make sure things weren't too fine and found nothing out of the ordinary. The problem with the Cougar was that it wasn't very fast, its handling was soft and loggy, it didn't stop too well and was generally unimpressive.
It was the dowager of the group, and certainly didn't like the idea of being thrown in among all that brute riffraff. That was a source of embarrassment not only to Cougar but to us. Individual Cougars we have tested in the past have seemed lovely cars. Yet, when we got the Cougar face to face with the other sporty cars, the conclusion was inescapable. It was a stone. An elegant stone, a comfortable stone, but a stone nonetheless.
Drag strip performance of the Cougar was a ho-hum  Moreover, the car never felt that it was trying very hard, and the Ford 3-speed automatic gave everyone fits when trying to shift manually. The problem wasn't quite as extreme on the Mustang, but it was present to a degree on that car as well. The problem lay in trying to make a clean first-second shift or second-third shift without bypassing the desired gear.
There was a vague feeling, accompanied—only in the Cougar—by a long lag before the transmission actually chose to shift itself. The Cougar tripped all over itself out on the handling track. The car has a lot of overhang at both ends and a large flat spot in the engine's performance curve which made it very unresponsive.
On top of that we discovered that the oil pick-up in the engine sump uncovered itself during cornering to allow the lifters to go dry. Then, as this portion of the test progressed, someone noticed an object that dropped off the car on the short straight. It was part of a front disc brake pad that had shattered. Earlier, the Cougar's performance in the braking tests had been none too good, with the brakes fading into near nothingness on the second stop.
Now, during a handling test that hadn't bothered any of the other cars, the Cougar's right front brake blew itself apart—something was seriously wrong. The next day the car was returned to Mercury to have the pad replaced, but instead the whole caliper assembly was returned to Detroit for evaluation.
It seems that a couple of rivets had sheared, knocking the brake puck out of alignment, putting extraordinary stress on it, which eventually resulted in the puck shattering under hard braking.
So much for any more handling tests with the Cougar. The Cougar's strong points proved to be the same things that you would look for in a family sedan: quality of material and construction, ride comfort, convenience, etc. The interior looks great with neat if not very comfortable seats, a wood-grained dashboard and plenty of instruments to bewilder and impress those who haven't the foggiest notion what is going on.
It's all very British with lots of switches and peculiar numbering and funny shaped needles on the gauges. It's so British in fact that they've stuck the oil pressure gauge over in front of the passenger well out of the driver's line of vision. One nice idea shared by both Mustang and Cougar was the tripometer incorporated into the speedometer.
The Cougar was the only car to come with disappearing headlights as standard equipment. While these help the appearance of the car from a distance, the vertical members of the grille never lined up right giving the car a kind of snaggle-toothed grin when viewed from dead ahead. In short, Attila is compatible with virtually any device you might want to use it with. Neoseeker "… The Cougar Attila headset was very light and portable while providing a quality audio solution!
Funkykit "Cougar has brought us an extremely affordable Earbud Headset, the Attila, that can be used for full blown gaming sessions behind your desktop or used on-the-go easily carried in your back pocket.
