Anyone interested in serving as a member of the committee can submit an application online or send an email requesting that an application be sent to them. Members of the committee will not be compensated, and they must cover their own expenses if they need to travel to Austin as part of their duties. Legislation in the most recent session allows TDLR advisory boards and commissions to meet via videoconference, so any travel may be limited.
All applications will be considered, and TDLR will contact applicants who were chosen to serve on the committee. Please note that business owners may choose to require additional safety protocols related to COVID safety. Individuals are strongly encouraged to wear masks over the nose and mouth wherever it is not feasible to maintain six feet of social distancing from another person who does not live in the same household.
According to the Governor's executive order, nothing prevents businesses — including hair, esthetician and nail salons, lash salons, barber shops, barber or cosmetology schools, laser hair establishments or massage establishments — from requiring employees or customers to follow additional hygiene measures, including wearing a mask.
Driver Education schools may choose to require employees or students to wear masks and to social distance. The order also strongly encourages all Texans to use good-faith efforts and available resources to follow the DSHS health recommendations. Our first priority is to provide answers to your questions.

In order to assist your student in finding alternate driver education curriculum, we have compiled a list of driver education schools that have expressed interest in accepting displaced students. You may also find a complete list of licensed driver education schools and parent-taught course providers on the TDLR website. You should be aware that when enrolling in another program, you may be required to pay for those services.
We have been asked about the possibility of refunds for the cost of the tuition paid to the school. We are not aware of another regulatory avenue to access refunds.
We would recommend that you seek your own private legal counsel to discuss your rights in this matter. Frequently Asked Questions FAQs regarding driver education school closures can be found on the website , in an effort to provide information to all students and answer your questions.
Your email must include the following:. The following schools have contacted TDLR about the possibility of enrolling displaced Sears students in their programs. You may contact these schools individually to discuss the enrollment options which may be available to you. Please continue to check back, as the website will be updated with additional information. We do not conduct or do the DMV drive test. When a student completes our program DMV is recognizing that the drive section that they pass with our program meets or exceeds their standards of a drive test.
Students who are 18 and older or turn 18 during the course will still need to complete a driving test at the DMV after completion of our program. Home school students can qualify through the school district they are in. This may result in bill of the difference between what you paid and the full cost of the course.
Completions will take two full business days for processing before the driver will be eligible to be issued a full unrestricted license. All other completions can be mailed to the address below. It is the responsibility of the driver to supply the Division of Driver Licensing with the completed information. Toggle navigation Share this page.
