I replaced an HP with this model. HP sure is trying hard to burn some bridges here. I won't be buying an HP product again. I bought this printer last year. I was also a bit suprised. I bought this printer summer which was my 6th printer by HP and now there isn't even a driver that I can download from windows-update. My mother has the Deskjet Cxi which is about 10 years old and she can install drivers for Windows 7.
Don't tell me my printer is to old! I expect driver support for more years. If HP doesn't deliver new drivers I am definitly going to the competition and will never by a product of HP again. I was trying about three things at once, so future posters may be able to work through what I've done and simplify this by taking out unnecessary steps.
Find a PC on your network that is still running XP and has the n attached as a network printer. On the Win 7 PC, download the Universal Printer Driver from HP support I used the one provided under laserJet , as this seemed closest in number to what I wanted - but as it's named "universal", maybe there is only one anyway. Run the executable. Hey Presto! Hope that is more help than HP have been so far. I'm also very disappointed. Just bought a new HP Pavilion notebook with bit Windows 7 and now my almost brand new N is unsupported.
The driver installed without a problem and the test page prints just fine from Windows 7. Thanks for the lead. Learn more Continue. Show location.
