You'll also see the occasional related minor problem but they are inconveniences which can be put up with or overcome. View solution in original post. Guerdon jphughan. Hi guys! A miracle has happened. Over the weekend I tried many things, nothing worked. And it works!!!! Now I can resend my DP dongles and cables, but it is unbelievable, many thanks and kudos to you guys,. I'm not sure from where you got my name but suspect it was from my earlier posts on the U If so, you've probably already seen the answer, although it's probably not what you want to hear.
Regardless, you may well need:. This may well be your only realistic option. Anyway, the net result is that I very much suspect that your only option will be an HDMI connection and whilst that's not officially supported i. An example is at the end of that Dell thread, there are many others on that Whirlpool thread who confirm this too, as well as myself who used HDMI to U at x at 60 59? Hz for several years, before moving to DP with a new PC.
I have no personal experience of this but it looks like you might well have that sort of thing as another option. Please post an update of what you manage to achieve. You probably have an HDMI cable lying around somewhere, so maybe try that first anyway. Deinamite Actually I might have good news for you. Even if your systems don't have video-capable USB-C ports, I found this active converter that is explicitly designed to convert an HDMI source signal to a DisplayPort output, so as long as your system supports at least x via HDMI, you can use this converter to send that to your display's DisplayPort input.
Note that this conversion direction is the opposite of the way the vast majority of DisplayPort to HDMI adapters work, so if you decide not to buy the exact product I linked although I definitely recommend Cable Matters since they have a solid reputation for quality products , then be very careful looking at alternatives, because most DisplayPort to HDMI adapters -- including most active ones -- are designed to switch a DisplayPort source signal to HDMI.
The USB connection required by this converter is for power. See my response to jphughan. However, even if it would work, it would not be convenient as I would have to switch cables every time I switch between Surface laptop and Acer laptop,.
Unfortunately I am very close to the conclusion that it will be impossible to get the desired resolution from the hdmi or dvi-d inputs, must be something hard-coded wrong in the Dell U This is what I tried:. Immediately and automatically it displayed at 4k.
Conclusion, no problem with the hdmi output of the laptop, and no problem with the hdmi cable. Connected the new laptop with the same hdmi cable as used under 1. Yes Left swivel Maximum swivel degree of the display to the left of the stand axis. Yes Forward tilt Maximum degree of forward tilting of the display.
