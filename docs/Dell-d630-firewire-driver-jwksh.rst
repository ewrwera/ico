Sign up now. The TI chipset are found on the more expensive cards, but they don't seem to work very well in Windows  The above cards have both a Firewire 4 pin and 6 pin ports. When you buy a Firewire card try to find one that looks the the photos above. Remember, they are sold under various brand names. Firewire Cards Below is a picture of a Firewire card.
As you can see in the picture, the Firewire cards have a power connector that you need to connect to your computer's power supply. If you don't connect a power supply connector to it, it will not function properly. NOTE: Firewire cards do not have or need a power supply connection. Beside the Firewire cards giving us problems for video capture, other people have had reported to us that they had problem with video capturing with Firewire cards.
I tested the 12 different Firewire cards, most of them were identical to the ones in the pictures above, they were just being sold under different brand name. No matter what I tried, I just could not get them to work with these devices. They would only connect to the Sony DSR editing deck.
The TI chipset cards gave me so many problems, so please stay away from them and only get the VIA chipset card. We could not get either Firewire cards to work with video capture.
But they did work with an older scanner. What about a Firewire to Thunderbolt adapter? It will only show up as a Thunderbolt port in Device Manager and not as a Firewire port. As I stated above, the Firewire driver looks for a Firewire chipset on either the motherboard or on an expansion card that is plugged into one of the slots on the motherboard. I have talked to about 14 different people on various forums about capturing MiniDV footage this way and only 2 people said they were able to get this to work, everyone else were unsuccessful.
I recently tried using these adapters myself and I could not get it work. So I don't recommend wasting your money and time on Thunderbolt adapters as a way to capture video from a MiniDV camcorder or MiniDV editing deck, they don't work for that. Most video capture software or audio processing software or scanner software need to work directly with the IEEE Firewire driver and the Firewire driver will never see a Firewire port chipset since it is not built-in to the motherboard or installed in an expansion slot.
With all of that said, I have seen people who have used the above adapters to connect an external Firewire hard drive to a computer via the Thunderbolt port, with success. These adapters do NOT work for video and audio transfers. FireWire transfers data as a steady stream, while a USB connection transfers data as packets and thus they are not compatible.
While there are Firewire to USB hubs not adapters as shown below , these are more expensive than a FireWire card for your computer and some users have complained that the hubs are problematic.
Users have reported that they have electrically damaged the Firewire port on their camera or electrically damaged the USB port on their computer when attempting to use a Firewire to USB adapter. Firewire Ports that are built-in to the Motherboard. You will need to make sure this is set to Enable or ON. Some software only allow you to work with footage that comes from an SD card or from the Hard Drive. We use Vegas Pro and Vegas Movie Studio and both of those software packages support capturing video through the Firewire port.
Make sure what ever video capture program you are using, that you turn off the Device Control in the video capture program. If it is not turned off, you may run into problems trying to capture the video footage. Depending the the software you may also need a special driver for the audio software, in addition to the Firewire Driver.
Farther down in the article, under Step 13, I show you have to check to see if the Device Manage will see the connected audio device. Using a Firewire connection with a Photo an Slide Scanners If you have a scanner, such as a Nikon scanner, you may find it will not work with Windows 10, even if you have a built-in Firewire port or a Firewire expansion card.
The problem here is the scanner driver or software will not work under Windows  Download the demo version of the software and try it out. This have solved problems for people using Canon, Nikon and a host of other scanners that are connected through the Firewire port.
Don't worry if the scanner doesn't show up in the Device Manager, as long as the device manager sees the Firewire card, the above scanner software should find it. NOTE: I have heard from a lot of people having problems when trying to use a Firewire card with a TI chipset with their scanner, even the the scanning software. As soon as they switched to a Firewire card with the VIA chipset, like the ones I have shown you above, they had no more problems.
