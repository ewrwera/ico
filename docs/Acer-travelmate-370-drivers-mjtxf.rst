Hi I have got a big problem with my wifi, I have done everything in my power but still no look. Wifi still worked at that point, I went in to safe mode, and since that day the wifi has stopped working.
Can you please help. I was having a similar wifi problem. My Wifi displays other wifi network but I cannot see my network.
I can use the wifi network in other devices. Have you tried manually searching for the network? What are your PC specs? Did it work ok before or has this always been an issue? It seems as though if I use the mouse, or do anything else on the right side facing the system screen in the standard laptop position that my arm or whatever else blocks the WIFI signal or weakens it. When I move my arm, it comes back. Even when I have the ethernet cable plugged in, it seems to happen.
It is a very strange anomaly… However, it is a consistent one and has been that way since I purchased in  AND, there is a magnetic property on the front of the system which makes me wonder if it is causing interference. Have you contacted Acer? I have the same problem. Just turned on the laptop this morning and there are no options to connect to wifi just dial up option only.
I have uninstalled and reinstalled the driver despite the tests showing the driver Atheros was not faulty. Still no change to the wifi availability though.
I guess it needs a different card or something? This brings me to my question — do you think it might be a wireless card issue? I had my laptop serviced yesterday and perhaps they did something inadvertently? Hi Maree — I am assuming that before you sent your laptop in for service the wifi was working ok?
It may be the case that the required driver has either become corrupt or is out-of-date can happen if the OS is updated etc. You can register the software to automate this if you prefer. If it is not a driver issue come back to us and we will look into it further. I have done a driver scan and no problems were revealed.
I had uninstalled and reinstalled the driver and there has been no change in the ability to find the wireless. The service that was done was to find the cause of my battery not charging any more. While the laptop was being checked, they cleaned it and that was the extent of the service — no other installations have occured. I think the easiest option if it is not the WiFi Drivers would be to setup your network connection again.
Hi There. I really hope you can help! I used my wireless connection for a very long time and all of a sudden it just stoped working. I have the acer aspire one and use my blackberry as a hotspot. I restored factory settings to see if that might help, but no luck.
Please please help?? Could this have been accidentally toggled? Hey Mate, thanks for such an easy guide, you just solved my problem, which no one I know could solve. Does the Aspire XC, windows 8. I see no switch, icon or key to enable it. Select the Hardware tab 3.
Click on the Device Manager button 4. Is the connection noticeably slower than on other devices using the same connection? Are you using wireless? Hi can you please help I bought my daughter an acer aspire E15 for Christmas and the wifi was working fine until 3 days ago and now we have a wifi connection but it will not connect to the internet.
I am at my wits end as I do not know what to do as she needs this for school work. Have you tried connecting other devices to the wifi? If the problem is not with the wifi then it is likely a wifi toggle switch either on the laptop itself or one of the function keys details in article. I have the similar problem, i just bought one acer aspire e 15 as a gift for my son, but or it cannot detect my home wifi while can found neighbors , or detect my wifi, but cannot connect to it, or finally connect it but lost it in a few minutes, could you help me out.
You can run the free drivers scan using the download link — this will tell you the exact Wireless Drivers you need there are many different ones — you can then search for and install them yourself or register the software and let the program do it for you.
Noticed that my wifi button at top of the keyboard was not lit so thought the button had been toggled by accident. Tried to open it up again but cannot. Any other thoughts? Hi Kate — have you rebooted since the problem happened?
Is the connection definitely ok — have you tried connecting to the WiFi using another device? All of my other devices work great on my network.
Please help. My Acer aspire E has a problem with its wifi if i say conect it tells me windows is unable to connect why is that? My acer aspire wont connect with wifi, it say windows cant connect please help me why is that? My acer aspire showing wireless network but can not connect to it though was working fine till last night.
Wifi is put on by pressing the button at top left corner next to bluetooth button. The wi-fi option is not even available, it just lets me connect with a an ethernet cable to the router, that a computer uses.
I have no idea which driver I should install, because when I went to change my adapter settings there was only Ethernet and nothing else. What do I do to fix this problem. This has already happened another time, but at that time I turned of the laptop and turned it back on later that day, and everything was back to normal, meaning that I could connect to wireless connections.
I have an acer aspire E15, it has 3 accounts on it mine, my partners and guest. About a month ago it stopped connecting to the Internet wifi or Ethernet , once I ran the virus scan and updated the firewall it started working again.
My brother in law was using my partners account to watch sky go and got logged out. After this the Internet isnt working at all. Wifi or Ethernet. It cannot detect nor find internet connection and even WIFI. The status is always unavailable. Please help thanks! Hi Abel — this is most likely a Drivers issue as Windows 7 and Windows XP require different sets of Drivers — try the free Drivers scan link in article above — this will tell you if you have missing Drivers and provide you with their details.
Hi i have an acer travelmate its conects to to my wifi from my router but does not ask me for password? Hi Jason — it should be connecting to the internet via your WiFi — you may not have a password set up — have a look at the security settings as you should have one. Hi John — is your internet connection good enough to run the Drivers Scan? Was your connection better in the past — if so, can you think of any changes software install, updates etc. My acer has always connected to my wifi but now is very temperamental.
Mainly not pairing. All other laptops and phones do tho with no problem. Hope u can help. Hey, I was hoping you could give me a little more help? All other devices can connect to it including his DS. Do you have any other advice? Sorry for the bother. Hi Sarah — is your primary connection showing at all or showing and not connecting?
Solved by going to network connections in control panel and right clicking on wi-fi,to change disable to enable. I can reconnect but this keeps happening every couple minutes and is very annoying. I do not have this problem with any other devices. Does anyone know what is wrong and how to solve it?
Hi Radha — this sounds like a power save issue. To fix this try turning off power save mode of the network adapter. It was working fine up until 3 hrs ago when bigot to work. My phone is also connected to this same network. I called acer support and he had me restore system settings, uninstall a driver. He also had me do the f3 to check airplane mode and also toggled the wifi on and off.
Can I clarify that it was working ok on home network but not on work one? Can you tell us the model and OS. I had slow wifi on my acer aspire e 15 for a couple years.
I tried all the internet tips like power settings, updated the driver etc. Finally edited the wifi adapter settings and now it works properly for the first time. It may not work for you but might be worth a try. Good luck.
