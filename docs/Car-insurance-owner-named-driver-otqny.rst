The one being removed must do it themselves or give their explicit permission. It is important a driver knows when they are being removed from a policy, and divorce is no exception. An agent or representative will either contact the person you wish to remove as named insured or request that person contact them before taking any steps to remove them.
In many instances, an insurance company will require the named insured to fill out and securely sign a form before removing them. In some cases, a new policy must also be in place, and proof of insurance must be provided to the insurance company to remove the named insured from the existing policy.
Additional or authorized drivers on a car insurance policy are those who live in the same household as the named insured and drive the vehicle on the policy.
However, claims will not be paid out in their name even if they were the driver at the time of the accident. Additional drivers are covered only when driving the vehicle in the policy. For example, if an additional insured driver were to be hit by another car while walking to the vehicle, their injuries would not be covered under the insurance policy.
