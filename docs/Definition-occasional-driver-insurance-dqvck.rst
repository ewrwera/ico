However, this form of insurance is only available in certain circumstances such as collectible cars or a shared vehicle.
Primary and occasional driver insurance are not different policies. Instead, a person is named as either the primary or occasional driver on a policy. The most common example of this is in the case of a family vehicle where one person likely drives the vehicle every day for things like commuting while another person uses the vehicle less frequently for short trips around town.
The commuter would be the primary driver in this case. Whereas occasional driver insurance allows two or more drivers use a vehicle without having to take out multiple policies on the same vehicle. An example where an insurer would specifically issue an occasional driver policy without a named primary driver is in the case of something like a collectible car that is not used on a daily basis.
Occasional driver insurance can get complicated in the case of families that have multiple vehicles.
Typically a person must not use the car more than 25 percent of the time to be considered for the discount. Downgrading a teenage or young adult driver to occasional driver status could save you a substantial sum on your total insurance costs each month. If you believe that someone on your insurance may qualify as an occasional driver, it is worth the small investment of time to call and see if you are eligible for the discount.
There are many other ways to save a percentage of your current car insurance payment each month. Additionally, insurance companies often will not allow an occasional driver to be listed if there are more vehicles than drivers in the household.
Occasional driver insurance is more economical than insurance for primary drivers. When drivers operate a vehicle less frequently than a primary driver, the risk of their having an accident is reduced because they are not on the road as often. Therefore, the cost of insuring them is lower and they customarily get the same coverage at a cheaper rate.
Typically, you can insure as many drivers as you think may be using the vehicle. Insuring a driver under occasional driver status can be a way to ease the financial burden of insuring multiple drivers, especially if these additional drivers have limited access to a vehicle and do not own it.
