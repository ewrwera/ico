The impact drill is like new, however, the drill has been used to do small projects for church. Here is how it broke in half when it fell off of my workbench 28 inches high onto the floor in my garage. I know it's over a year, however, I have had several drills before and they worked for years!
No problems. The shipping invoice is very faint, however, here is the salescheck , shipped to: James H. Please advise. Thank you for your assistance. James H Whitaker  Do not buy this set. I have had these less than 2 years used them a few times around the house.
Both of the batteries went out at the same time they won't even charge anymore. The warranty is only good for one year with a receipt. I was also told that they won't even be making those batteries anymore. I have to say that I am disappointed at craftsmen for this product. I could also assure you that my next drill set will not be a Craftsman product. Purchased to replace the old cordless drills and could not be more pleased. Plenty of power and battery life.
