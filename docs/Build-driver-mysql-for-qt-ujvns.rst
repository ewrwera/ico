This problem will not occur if query1 and query2 use different database connections, or if we execute query2 after the while loop. Note: Some methods of QSqlDatabase like tables , primaryIndex implicity execute SQL queries, so these also cannot be used while navigating the results of forward-only query.
Install the appropriate PostgreSQL developer libraries for your compiler. When you distribute your application, remember to include libpq.
QTDS is obsolete from Qt 4. It is not possible to set the port with QSqlDatabase::setPort due to limitations in the Sybase client library. Refer to the Sybase documentation for information on how to set up a Sybase client configuration file to enable connections to databases on non-default ports.
Regardless of which library you use, the shared object file libsybdb. Set the SYBASE environment variable to point to the directory where you installed the client library and execute qmake :.
LIB to build the plugin:. By default, the Microsoft library is used on Windows. The DB2 header and include files should already be installed in the right directories. The Qt SQLite 2 plugin is offered for compatibility. Whenever possible, use the version 3 plugin instead. The build instructions for version 3 apply to version 2 as well. SQLite is an in-process database, which means that it is not necessary to have a database server.
SQLite operates on a single file, which must be set as the database name when opening a connection. If the file does not exist, SQLite will try to create it. SQLite also supports in-memory and temporary databases. Simply pass respectively ":memory:" or an empty string as the database name.
SQLite has some restrictions regarding multiple users and multiple transactions. This is due to SQLite associating the type of a value with the value itself rather than with the column it is stored in. A consequence of this is that the type returned by QSqlField::type only indicates the field's recommended type.
No assumption of the actual type should be made from this and the type of the individual values should be checked. The driver is locked for updates while a select is executed. SQLite version 3 is included as a third-party library within Qt. It can be built by passing the -qt-sqlite parameter to the configure script. If you do not want to use the SQLite library included with Qt, you can pass -system-sqlite to the configure script to use the SQLite libraries of the operating system.
This is recommended whenever possible, as it reduces the installation size and removes one component for which you need to track security advisories. However the needed implementation must be provided by the user. For better performance the regular expressions are cached internally. By default the cache size is 25, but it can be changed through the option's value.
I mean I have libmysql. According to visual, those dlls are found but an issue occurs with libmysql. I have the dlls in the place described in step 5 and 6. According to visual they are found. But I have a first chance exception while loading libmysql. Are you using the correct compiler? Since this is a tutorial for minGW and not the visual studio compiler. In file included from. Release recipe for target '. I am using the exact instructions you included, down to the MySQL install config.
I was wondering if this was something to do with my MySQL environment variables, but that seems to check out. Just curious if you ran into anything like this? You're probably right that you have a problem with the MySQL environment. More info about that can be found in the article. I am sure I have a minor issue somewhere. I would really like to compare what I am using to what you have set, thank you! You can delete my previous comment, thank you very much for this very helpful tutorial!
I will make sure to distribute this link to others that I know are having the same trouble. I was not including my mingw "lib" in my environment variables. After fixing that - we are good to go. Did you get any kind of error message?
Make sure to adjust the paths in the tutorial to the actual install paths on your system. Sir we really appreciate your work and really you have done a great work by giving a Comprehensive tutorial. Thanks alot Release recipe for target '.. Thanks for sharing the info.
There seems to be quite a mess in the msi MySQL installer, but then e got the version that worked. I am indeed very greatful for this tutorial. I would never had managed to find out this procedure myself. They are included in qt-windows-opensource Next instructions allowed me to create driver that flawless works with 5. Check if directory structure contains lib folder with libmysql.
As a next step you need to run cmd with all exported variables and tools. Now you done preparation of environment. If you installed sources with Qt installation then they should be somewhere in installation path as Src folder.
