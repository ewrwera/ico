You will need Win XP drivers for your video card, the network adapter, and if you want, sound. The sound driver is likely to be the most difficult because it is usually specialized for the main board. If you have an add-on sound card it may make things a bit easier in that department. I don't think there is anything "regrettable" about the fact that AHCI cannot be turned off Another two years or so, and it may be practically impossible to install XP on a new computer :. I respect your opinion, and I don't deny there are many good things about advancing technology, but sometimes the new technology doesn't support applications that an owner needs for his business.
It then becomes an economic concern as not all small businesses can support upgrading the hardware and their applications at the same time.
My employer converted to Vista only about a year ago and is probably still contemplating Windows 7. Naturally if people wish to have support for their ADP they will need to make the jump eventually, but it would be nice if there were a gentle way to do it. While I completely agree with you and understand the reasons for needing to do so - we still have servers on because the software is too expensive to upgrade to be compatible with - I also think the advancement of technology suffers when they try too hard to make things backward-compatible.
As the is a home system, I might assume it is to keep from having to purchase new software cannot blame him there but we see all the time a reluctance to move to something new or simply away from XP, as people are comfortable using it.
XP will never be back and OS's will continue to move foward - I don't think there is a better time to acclimatize than now. We've both been around the forums for a while - I respect the work you do here and the knowledge you share. Don't take this as any more than a friendly discussion : I have also helped countless people install unsupported OS's, including XP, so I'm not opposed to helping those who either need or just want to install XP Setting it to compatibility is not the best choice for installing XP either - using the correct driver as you have advised is ideal.
Run the installer with the -a switch to extract the files. This will NOT install the software, just extract the files. Great stuff people.. I too wish that Vista had never been born, what a load of rubbish.
Great site here, thanks again.. Wes S 2 Bronze. Being cautious I installed a second harddrive just to play with the installation.
My first attempt was to simply edit the boot sequence to boot from a CD. So I downloaded a lite version of Nero and burned another coaster. This time I got by the pci error but encounterd "ohci That got me here. But this got me back to the "pci. Examining the. My last try was to use nLite only to merge the driver with the slipstreamed file s that I did using dos on the other XP machine and burning the image with nLite.
The machine now boots into Windows setup without the pci or ohci errors but then asks that the original XP CD be installed. It reads this for a few seconds and then asks for the SP2 CD at which time it enters an endless loop. Intel's support is not formally provided in this user forum.
