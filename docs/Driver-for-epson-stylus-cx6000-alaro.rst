See review on Facebook. Victor C Glanville. Hamrick Software - I have been using VueScan for 10 years on several different computers using 3 scanner models. It really is an excellent product well maintained and exceptional value for money. It has given me a lot of pleasure over the years and helped produce some high quality scans of vintage family photography.
I can recommend it to anyone. Tim Flanigan. I am absolutely in love with this software! Thanks to VueScan, it back online and working better than ever. It is so efficient and easy to use that I'm looking forward to scanning several thousand slides that have been stored away and unusable. My scanner now works so much better than it did originally that I am incredulous. I purchased the Pro version and it is worth every penny of the reasonable price. Love it! Thank You Hamrick!!!
Marc Bodewes. I used it a lot, more functions than the standard driver. Got new computers with new operating systems, forgot about VueScan. I got a new Epson scanner - old one doesn't have Win10 drivers. I remembered VueScan.
