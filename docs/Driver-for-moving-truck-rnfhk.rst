With local moving truck rentals, you pick up and drop off at the same location. This makes it a convenient option for a local move or local delivery. U-Haul is the only truck rental company that works with manufacturers to design a truck specifically for household moving. This means U-Haul trucks are built lower to the ground, have rounded corners, chassis skirts, comfort cabs and a multitude of other special options to make each truck easy to load, comfortable to drive and efficient on fuel.
U-Haul trucks are specially engineered from the ground up to move families, not freight. Our 26' rental truck combined with our 6' x 12' cargo trailer gives you the most capacity for your furniture in the self moving industry. U-Haul offers everything from a pickup truck rental for a local delivery to the 26' moving truck rental for a large family move.
With every phase of your life, come moments when you can rely on U-Haul trucks to help you get the job done.
For added convenience, U-Haul moving trucks are capable of towing your car on a car carrier. Even the 10' truck, which is the smallest moving truck you can tow with, can tow a vehicle and the 15' truck will tow up to 10,lbs. Cross Country Driver.
