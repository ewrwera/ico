The good point is: the sounding is awesome! Like when you run EF2. Are them is good? JMFahey said:. Mosfet or not, I'd feel very uneasy using a Sot cased transistor to drive an output power transistor.
Heat is heat and it must be dissipated. Those 2W must certainly refer to impossible-in-practice "leads at constant 25 DegC " Lab specs. I'm quite certain a little Sot dissipating 2W will burn a hole in my finger if I touch it. A 2W device cannot work at 1. But could it survive mW, or mW, or mW? That's the question:. What is the voltage across the r R45 emitter resistor? Yes I am running them 'hot'. Cordell's models exhibit a lower threshold voltage in simulation than the physical devices do in real life.
This means some values need to be adjusted between the simulation and real life, such as the pre-driver Re needing to be larger in value. I don't have much practical experience with SMD so I can't offer you a valid opinion with respect to what is acceptable in terms of dissipation. If you know the approximate dissipation you can estimate its temperature rise and decide if that will be acceptable or not.
Q10 will invert the signal but its base-emitter voltage will limit the input to Q2 and Q3 to basically zero.
How are you planning on keeping the gate drive transformer out of saturation? Common source output stages are tricky because of high and poorly controlled gate threshold voltage. I would use bipolar transistors for the output for this reason. What kind of output currents and edge speeds are you looking for?

You may wonder Why? We simply have to accept it. One could describe the situation by saying that Paul Dirac. ArdWar Contributor Posts: 44 Country:. Quote from: ArdWar on February 09, , am. But I had a pretty bad gate drive signal on the mosfets. Would a picture of the the gate signal and my setup help to find a good solution for my problem?

Well, your choices are limited. You could use a TVS diode from gate to source, and a resistor in series with the gate to clamp Vgs. Of course that will slow down the switching and you'll have higher switching losses. Same goes with the supply voltage- The TL only draws a couple of mA, so a shunt regulator could work at the cost of more power dissipation. Sign up to join this community.
