Saw this putter listed as "Value" so I was a little skeptical, but for the price I decided to try it. Definitely happy I did. Looks much better than expected, minor wear on the grip but that's about it. Bargain at the price and made me much more comfortable when looking at anything considered "Value".
Pros Great price "Value" plays just as well as "Excellent". Game Improvement December 13,  I retired this year and this past summer was my 1st season I could practice and play multiple times a week. The Wilson D's are a great game improvement up grade from the 15 year old, worn grips and grooves I was playing. They were shipped promptly and received several days a head of their ETA.
They look great. The grips don't show any wear at all. However the club faces do show a little more ball wear than I thought they would for "very good" condition. Pros Timely delivery at a good price. These irons will improve my confidence and score. Great stuff December 13,  Patina Del Monte putter December 12,  Putter is a little too much up right for me, Needs to be bent flatter otherwise felt solid.
