If there are no native drivers, you will have to check with HP support. I would also suggest you to post your query in the HP support forum. Was this reply helpful? Yes No. Sorry this didn't help. Thanks for your feedback.

Do Windows 7 Work On Windows 8. Page 1 of 2 1 2 Next. Posted 20 March - AM I need some drivers for my asus laptop, I went to the asus website and the only drivers I could find for the problem I have is for windows 7.
Would they still work on my computer? The drivers are for my keyboard and touchpad. Edit: sorry that the tittle sounds weird, I messed up typing it. I just uninstall the broken drivers, then download those, and just open them?
