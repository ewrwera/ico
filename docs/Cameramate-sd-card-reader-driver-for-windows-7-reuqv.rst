I have been a very busy person and needed to have my attention on a lot of other stuff, but that is all personal. I have tried all the above solution and with no result.
I have now bought a USB3. But my "built in" still does not. I even tried one belonging to a friend of mine that fits in the same 3-something inch slot as mine, but again to no luck. I am completely out of ideas and puzzled by it. But By now I will wave the white flag I give up. I have a working method now and not gonna put more energy in it, mostly because of the lack of time I will have from now on due to work and other personal stuff.

Original Title: SD card reader problem on windows 10 Dear Microsoft, Eventhough I am pleased with Windows 10 as an operating system I have an issue with your card reader recognition of cards SD card I upgraded to Windows 10 last summer.
I blamed the hardware it was an old one and bought a new one brand Akasa, but don't ask me the model number I installed it and the first impression was that it worked well. Ofcourse I have tried to get rid of the problem entirely by reinstalling the device completely removed the device from the hardware list I have never used the manufacturers drivers.
I also right clicked "this computer" and then went to "manage" Not sure if those are the exact translations, since I am using the Dutch language and I am not a native English speaker Under "Disk management" I could not find the SD card inserted when Windows did not recognize the Card.
