See the entire gallery. Their facebook page has a pic of trophy with caption the trophy no one wants. Tell that to kevin who passed several difficult challenges and then rives into oncoming traffic in the city driving test. Angelina shows up drunk on first day.
Dale is pretending she has alzheimer's. Kevin had to have a lot of courage and skill to pull off the stunts in the city driving test but these people would be anonymous losers otherwise so they'll do anything to extend their 15 minutes of fame. Lizard Lick is definitely not fake.
Kevin, from Burnaby, BC, representing Season 8, has returned to prove that rehab worked for him. After tying for the embarrassing title last year, Kevin and his partner Lenny have left their small town in British Columbia and moved to Burnaby. Kevin is blind in one eye, and is still licensed. His boyfriend is convinced that Kevin needs more training, or needs to be taken off the road… permanently.
Shelby originally came to Rehab to gain more confidence behind the wheel. He returns to the Rehab Centre with his brother Elerick. Sly has broken the BIG promise he made at the Rehab Centre: while driving, he still relies heavily on the GPS on his phone, and he still eats and drinks soda behind the wheel.
Dale, from St. Catharines, ON, from Season 6, continued to drive after her stay in Rehab, but is still clueless about road rules and signs.
With many mishaps and accident anecdotes, Dale is still a disaster behind the wheel. She returns to Rehab with her best girlfriend, Christine. Since Rehab, she has continued to drive, despite her ongoing difficulty reversing, parking, driving at night, and staying focused while behind the wheel.
Angelina leaves a trail of destruction practically every time she shifts into drive. He returns to Rehab as a confident daily driver. Shirley, from Donkin, NS, is coming back to finally graduate. Apparently, she still seems to drive just as bad as she did while on her original series.
What seems to be her problem? Perhaps more professional training is what she really needs, that and an attitude adjustment maybe? I watched most of what Dale Pitton did in season six and was disappointed. Wanting to make a change is the first part of a bad driver getting better. After all, who is she trying to convince with her excuses; her or her family and friends? I watched Sly Grosjean through season seven. He seems like such a nice guy, but not really aware of his driving surroundings.
