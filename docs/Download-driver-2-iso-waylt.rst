If this game had been on more capable hardware Dreamcast or PS2, hello! It offers engaging mission objectives, a great sense of urgency, a well-crafted story line, and a lot more diversity i. So what's my beef? How about a frame-rate so bogged down by the overly-ambitious concepts in Driver 2 that it almost seems like it's in slow motion. Curved roads are swell, but with popup so bad that entire buildings appear out of nowhere, you want to scream.
The control is fine and the game is really fun, but the engine struggles so mightily you wish it a painless death. Perhaps I'm just jaded these days, but with an office full of beautiful Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 games, seeing any title, even one as fun as Driver 2, plagued with slowdown and pop-up just irks me. Why wasn't this game released on the PS2?
Nearly every element is great, from the physics to level design, but it's hard to forgive huge buildings materializing right in front of you with no warning. If you can get over the graphics which was hard for me , you'll find an incredibly enjoyable game underneath.
It's madly challenging at times. The gameplay is still topnotch, but it just leaves me wanting a PS2 version even more. Browse games Game Portals. Driver 2. Install Game.
