The largest difference to the F1 aerodynamics package is the return to a ground-effect formula. Ground-effect underbody tunnels have not been permitted in Formula 1 since , but the calls for their reintroduction have become rather loud in recent years. F1 has sought to reduce the current reliance on wings for downforce, which have been blamed for the "dirty air" that has made close-quarters racing difficult in modern times, which meant the idea of a return to ground effects was more attractive to the rulemakers.
By creating a very pronounced entry at the front of the floor, the air moves through two Venturi tunnels. As the air flows under the car, it's squeezed through the point closest to the ground, developing an extreme low-pressure area, creating a large amount of suction underneath. This means the floor is relied on more for downforce, and reduces the wake produced by various bodywork components. Unlike the old-school ground effects, the car won't have sliding skirts, and instead has a range of fins underneath to minimise any disturbance.
To make sure each team uses the floor as it should, a standard tea-tray will be developed to attach to the front of the floor. There's a lot of change to the amount of bodywork for the next era of F1 cars. In , the massively complex bargeboards will be completely removed.
In their place comes a new breed of "wheel bodywork", which intends to minimise the effects of the wake produced by the wheels as they rotate. Wheel covers return, and the front wheels now have a deflector over the top to assist with this.
For the time being, DRS remains, but this can be revisited if the new cars produce the desired on-track product. In that time, there can only be one upgrade to the gearbox specification.
Suspension regulations now only permit springs and dampers, meaning that using solely torsion bars will no longer be allowed. The heave springs, or inerters, will also be banned to simplify the suspension systems. Suspension uprights must now be solely included within the wheel assembly, meaning no external mounting points may be permitted. The front wing has been redefined, and can now be made up of a maximum of four elements overall. Most crucially, the endplates now look very different, and are produced with a smooth blend from the front wing elements to a single-piece endplate, upturned like an aeroplane's wing.
The nose also attaches directly to the wing, much like it used to before the middle of the s. The rear wing has been redesigned too, and can almost be described as endplate-less.
Instead, it loops around into a beam-wing mounting, aiming to slash the strength of the vortices produced at the rear of the car - which is blamed for cars being unable to follow each other. The first-ever Miami Grand Prix will take place at the start of May, on a 3. There are also provisional returns for the Australian, Canadian, Singapore and Japanese grands prix, following their cancellation from the previous two seasons owing to the effects of COVID-related travel restrictions.
The European season will then begin, pausing for races in Azerbaijan and Canada, before the final set of flyaways begin in September, starting in Russia prior to the first events in Singapore and Japan since  China was not listed on the calendar despite holding a contract to do so, while Qatar will skip ahead of its hosting of the FIFA World Cup in the winter.
Pre-season testing is expected to take place at two venues, with the first three days being run at the Barcelona circuit from the February, with Bahrain hosting the second block of running from the March ahead of the grand prix. This will be the first opportunity to see the cars in action, although teams will naturally keep their cards close to their chest. The percentage values apply depending on where each team finishes.
