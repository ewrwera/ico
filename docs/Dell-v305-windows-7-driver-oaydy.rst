Manual Printer Driver Removal With the computer online, insert the Dell Vw printer disk, choose additional computer, network and follow the instructions. DellRockstar Welcome to Dell Community!

I left the printer USB cable disconnected as directed. During the installation process, I got an error saying there was a communication failure no kidding -- the cable was disconnected.
So I connected the cable, and the process started up again, but when it was done, I could not get comm with the printer. Disconnected the cable, rebooted.
No luck. So I uninstalled the printer driver again. And rebooted. I tried installing the printer driver again, and now, it installs everything, and immediately goes to the uninstall window and uninstalls everything and tells me to reboot. Also, when the installation comes up, the option blocks are preselected and grayed out. First run Delete Print Jobs to remove stuck print job s from the queue, then restart your computer.
Start, control panel, programs and features, Dell V Printer, uninstall. Delete the Program Files x86 x86 Folder. With the computer online, insert the Dell V Printer disk, choose new installation and follow the instructions. Didn't work. I deleted the Program Files x86 x86 Folder. I had problems deleting some of the files because they were in use by "Printer Transfer Card Monitor", so I killed off that app in task manager and deleted the rest of the files and the folder and subfolders Dell and Dell VW.
There was no printer to uninstall. I restarted the installation program I downloaded from the Dell site R I could not install from the disk, because I bought the PC before Windows 7 came out and I'm not sure I can still find the disk.
Anyway, as soon as the installation completed, the uninstall application immediately ran without my intervention , and asked me to reboot. Also, the install wanted me to install under the Program Files x86 x86 Folder, which I deleted, so I told it to install under Program Files x86 instead, but it went ahead and created the Program Files x86 x86 Folder again and tried to install in there.
Sounds like something is stuck. Is there a registry key or keys that control these processes? I was surprised that VW was still listed there, even though the driver had been uninstalled. I told it to uninstall from there, and of course, it couldn't because it didn't exist. Was this reply helpful? Yes No. Sorry this didn't help. Thanks for your feedback. After an aggravating 12 hours I found out how to get the DellV to work in win Not sure why Dell couldn't do this but anyway Win 10 says they are working and documents are indeed sent.
The printer says it's online and waiting to print. Both are lying. Set up your "new" printer in windows You will need to do "add a printer". You may not need to, but I did. If your's works like mine, it will now actually print instead of lying to you when you sens a document. Is it possible to get the V working?
