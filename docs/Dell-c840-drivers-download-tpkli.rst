You may be able to search and find some generic or 3rd party drivers that would work, but Dell does not have any to provide. I am in the same situation. I did email the person who offered to email the drivers, but no response so far. If anybody can send me the Win98 video drivers for a C, I be grateful. Post Reply. Top Contributor.
