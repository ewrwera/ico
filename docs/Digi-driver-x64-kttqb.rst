I have good news. A bit AnywhereUSB driver is expected very soon, possibly by next week. I'll keep you updated. It's looking more like a few weeks, unfortunately. Again, I'll be sure to keep you updated. I'm in the same position as DCP Are there any plans for a bit Windows driver for this? In many cases, I've also been able to use bit Vista drivers so hopefully a single bit driver could work on all the bit Windows OS's.
Thanks in advance for your patience! Just wanted to check back in- are the bit drivers still expected this month? I checked the drivers page and didn't see them yet The bit Edgeport driver is now available. Click the Driver section. Click the RealPort for Windows driver link and save to a location on the hard drive. Extract the RealPort driver that was downloaded. Click Add a New Device , as shown below: 8. Click the Next button.
Select the Digi device you want to install the COM port for, as shown below:  Select the specific device from the list if discovered. Choose Device not Listed if the device is not discovered by the RealPort installation wizard. The user must type of ip address of the terminal server during the Device Configuration screen if the device is not discovered by the RealPort installation wizard during the Configuration screen in Step  Ensure to select the Number of Comports and the Starting Comport is set properly.
Typically the default settings work in most situations.
