Thank you! Any more feedback? The more you tell us the more we can help. Can you help us improve? Resolved my issue. Clear instructions. Easy to follow. No jargon. Also learn how to change Windows 11 password. You also exclude driver updates in Windows 10 using Registry, but need to mention that editing the Registry is a risky process, and it may cause errors to your Windows installation if you make some mistakes. You can make a full system backup of your Windows 10 PC before doing this. Type regedit and hit Enter to open Registry.
Click OK. Step 5. Restart your Windows 10 PC and this setting will take effect. Read More. And on top of that you cant change it with group policy because windows 10 hasnt got gpedit. To be honest its an dissaster. Im facing this exact problem whit a euro headset from razer. Windows just keeps pushing those non good working drivers..
We should be able to install correct drivers made by the actual manufacturer of bought devices. I really dont get why this strategy is being forced. A subscription to make the most of your time. Try one month free. That is it. Restart your system, and Windows will no longer install drivers automatically.
After the restart, Windows will not download drivers automatically. To change that behavior in the future. As you can see, it is rather easy to disable automatic driver installation in Windows  Follow any one of the above methods, and you should be good. If you are wondering, the above settings especially group policy settings should stay intact even after you upgrade to another major Windows 10 version.
