According to Lee Willard, the tire designer responsible for the Corvette's Pilot Super Sports and Pilot Sport Cup 2s, Michelin has broken traditional tire compromises, such as the head-butting between wet and dry grip, with the use of advanced computer modeling.
How advanced? Michelin's mathematical model of a single tire, or the computer file that fully encapsulates the tire's design and performance, is comparable to the size of a mathematical model for an entire car.
Changing even a single filament in a cord—say, from high-strength steel to aramid, the stuff bulletproof vests are woven from—or even changing the cord's relative angle or weave results in a virtual tidal wave of other tiny changes no human could ever predict or compute.
Running a computer simulation on four tires, a process that took months in the s, now takes an hour, allowing engineers more time to fine-tune the final product.
If this pace continues, street tires will soon have more grip than the 1. New Cars. Buyer's Guide. Type keyword s to search. Today's Top Stories. View Photos. Plus, the pedals are set up for easy heel-and-toe downshifts. Mostly, though, one less-than-satisfactory element stood out: the Recaro seats.
They have decent support, but they rocked back and forth annoyingly in their mounts. Also, the throws of the manual shifter could be shorter. Lucid, reliable communication about the onset of tire slip, changes in pavement texture, load transfer, engine power, and grip under braking flows through the controls and the racing-style bucket. When the time comes to act, the car responds instantly.
Balancing understeer and oversteer through the long off-camber right- and left-handers of sector four is a satisfying ballet of incoming information and driver reaction. Steering weight increases progressively as the tires approach their limit and drops off when they exceed it. Throttle movements relay to the chassis instantaneously, and the load shifts that occur through the esses seem to happen in fluid slow motion.
The dual-clutch gearbox shifts so quickly that power seems uninterrupted; downshifts arrive as soon as you tap the paddle or shift lever. Unlike the Spyder in the handling test, the car at VIR exhibited no brake fade and maintained solid and reassuring brake-pedal feel throughout its lapping sessions. A look at the individual sector results reveals just a few ticks stolen here and there, but add enough fractions, and pretty soon you have a two-second advantage over the Cayman S.
The Corvette Z06 now offers a Z07 performance package that incorporates some of the best features from the top-of-the-line ZR1 , namely magnetorheological shocks, Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 tires, and Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes.
But the Z07 option makes the Z06 blossom into a frankly amazing track car. Although it cedes horsepower to the supercharged ZR1, the Z06 was just 1. Through the various zones we highlight on VIR, the Z06 was only slower than the ZR1 in the first sector, equal to it in sectors two and five, and faster in sectors three and four. The Z06 Corvette was 5. And the Vette felt as if it could run fast, repeatable laps all day long. They relinquish grip more progressively, but the snarling 7.
Say it with us now: If only the seats were more supportive and the shifter a little more cooperative. Still, its time was a good 1. The SLS is thrillingly fast, hitting  It has stout brakes and handles in a playful, oversteering manner if you switch off the stability control. That was demonstrated by its speed through both sector two the esses and sector four, an area that combines one turn after another and demands a chassis that is hyperfluent and responsive.
The 6. But the gear ratios on the seven-speed dual-clutch transmission are too short for track work; we found ourselves in between gears on several occasions. The gearbox is also slow to respond to up- and downshifts when used manually. But, man, what a car. This was reflected in decent but unspectacular sector times: There was more body roll, less communication between car and driver, and more understeer in the Turbo S than in the RS.
But, for a car that is so easy to live with every day,  Everyone agreed: The GT3 RS might not have been the fastest car in this particular Lightning Lap event, but it was the sweetest to drive.
It starts flattering its driver in the cabin, which is tailored to the serious pilot like no other car here. Going into the uphill esses, the RS was 2. Just like the GT3 we tested in , the true joy of the RS lies in its responses.
Like the Corvette, the GT3 RS wanted us to rag on it all day; unlike the Corvette, it felt small and nimble and barely rolled, dove, or squatted under duress. The LP Superleggera sheds weight and adds power in its quest for on-track dominance. More specifically, it gets 10 extra horsepower—up to —and loses 72 pounds compared with the LP we tested in  The suspension gets a dramatically stiffer tune, too.
This Lamborghini was one of the surprise performers of the test. Yet the Superleggera was even faster in a straight line than either the ZR1 or the LP, hitting  And it needed it, too, due to several mechanical issues. The Photon is an evolution of the MTS. It has the same mildly tuned hp, mid-mounted Corvette LS7 engine, now hooked up to an exotic sequential six-speed Hewland transmission.
Mosler also reduced the rear track by 1. The Photon showed the benefits of a slightly better power-to-weight ratio and slipperier aerodynamics in a straight line, reaching  The new Mosler also recorded the first sub And finally, possibly because of a burned shifter cable, the Hewland took about 0.
