Program errors that occur when you are opening files from network drives or you are saving files to network drives.
For more information about these program errors, see Slow network performance when you open a file that is located in a shared folder on a remote network computer. When you are troubleshooting any one of these issues, frequently, you have to do more than just stop or disable the services that are associated with the software.
Even if you disable the software component, the filter driver is still loaded when you restart the computer. You may be forced to remove a software component to find the cause of an issue. As an alternative to removing the software component, you can stop the relevant services and disable the corresponding filter drivers in the registry. It is not the DNS ports issue from  We have only been able to work around so far by disabling IPSec and rebooting, but will be trying the resolution, Wojciech, mentioned when possible.
I am still trying to narrow down which patches were applied to all the affected servers. I have an open ticket for this with PSS and will post back if I find more information. Mostly I was glad to see we aren't the only ones seeing this and wanted to help get the word out and escalate this issue. I will try to check it Tomorrow and I will let you know what patches was deployed when server entered ipsec blocking mode. As Joel wrote blocking mode didn't occur on and solution to this is pretty easy to implement in small environments.
In larger ones it is extremely difficult due to db servers downtime etc. Thanks for update. Actually you can verify the latest patched hotfix by checking the update history on that server. If there is any update on this issue please feel free to let us know. Right now I am awaiting for account creation and I will log support ticket to Microsoft since this is painful issue.
Curious if you can confirm that this is the case for your servers as well. It looks like IPSec was symptomatic of Winsock corruption. I was able to recreate the issue in a VM with a minimal install of Windows, patches and our managment software. Doing a "netsh winsock reset" does resolve the issue, but obviously, the aim is determine the cause and ultimately prevent it. Digging on my own I found the following KB which was helpful in diagnosing the winsock issue further:.
Using "netsh winsock show catalog" on our affected servers it looks like the following components are missing:. I am hopeful this will allow us to detect the issue before rebooting, but I am still working on determining the cause. This article is a little stale so I don't know if someone else had a more definitive answer. We ran into this issue today after some patches were applied these were security patches from October. I reviewed the registry and sure enough the registry key was missing so I ran the regsvr32 command and it rebuilt the key.
On reboot IPSec started up as expected.
