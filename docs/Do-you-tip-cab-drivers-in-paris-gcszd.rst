Top tip: Although restaurants and other businesses should make their policy clear, it's worth checking with your waiter that they will personally receive your tip rather than the company — particularly if you're paying by credit card.
People generally do not tip in bars and pubs in London. Bartenders sometimes hand back change on a tipping tray, although it's still up to you to choose to leave a tip. For room cleaning staff, you can leave an amount of your choosing on departure. All over the world hotel porters are usually tipped.
The proper amount for France would be approximately 1euro per piece of luggage as a rule-of-thumb. If your hotel concierge has been helpful to you and polite during your stay, then some kind of note in euros would be an acceptable tip. The total value would be a personal choice taking into consideration of just how helpful the concierge has been to you, combined with the calibre of hotel you have stayed at.
It is recommended to wait until the end of your stay to tip the concierge, otherwise if you tip for every phone call or event tickets, it could become very expensive, very quickly. Photo Author Jenny Downing. Often coat check stations will have a sign which will inform you of how much it is to check your coat.
In this situation tips are not necessary. Conversely if there is no sign or price displayed then a 1 or 2 euro tip per item should be enough. On rare occasions you may see an attendant at the entrance of a Paris restroom.
Similar to a coat checker, if there is a sign stating a monetary value then a tip is not necessary, and in fact you are paying to use the toilet. However if they do not imply I price to use the bathroom then you can leave a tip if you are satisfied with the cleanliness of the toilet, as it is their job to clean them. If the tour was already really expensive to start with then I would probably not give a tip unless the tour was amazing.
If you choose one of the many and now very popular FREE walking tours, then a tip is very much expected, but 5 or 10 euro should be enough due to the often large numbers on these tours. These are my favourite kind of tour, because the guides have to work for their money and they learn to find many ways to please customers while on the tour.
If the tour was good leave a tip. If the tour was amazing, be a little more generous. The etiquette at a barber or hairdresser in Paris would be to give a few euro tip on top of the final bill. Leave some coins on the tray and make their giorno. Cab drivers in Italy never expect a tip, so if you give one to them, they may be surprised.
But if any driver goes out of his or her way to assist you, give a small tip. Definitely tip your tour guide. This is the firm exception to the general when-in-Italy-no-tip-necessary practice. You should tip guides because that money is their main source of income. How much you give them will depend on the size of the tour and its length. Tipping is not expected for personal services like spa treatments, haircuts, or beauty salon services.
As always, if the service is extraordinary, then leave a cash tip in the amount of 10 percent of the total cost. Sign up for the Daily Wander newsletter for expert travel inspiration and tips.
