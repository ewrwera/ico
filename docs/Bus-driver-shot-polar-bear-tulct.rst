He told officers he used the dropped gun to fire at the suspects as they fled on Maclin Avenue in a dark-colored s Ford. Wagoner told investigators he believed the shooting may have been a gang initiation. He said he heard one of the suspects tell another to kill him "if you want to be all the way in the club, you have to kill the polar bear. Polar bear is street lingo to identify a person as white. So-called "polar bear attacks" and the "knockout game" are shorthand for black-on-white attacks.
Monday afternoon, Dayton Sgt. Richard Blommel said, "It's way too early in the investigation" to make connections to gang violence but police don't believe the attack was an attempted robbery. He said Wagoner was heavily sedated at Miami Valley Hospital when they attempted to interview him after the shooting.
The report also said Wagoner told police he grabbed the gun and shot at the fleeing men. Wagoner had told police that the assailants were black and that he thought the attack might have been a gang initiation. My chest feels like I've been hit with a sledgehammer. He later told police that one of the alleged attackers had told another that he needed to 'shoot a polar bear But his account wasn't found to be factual, Police Chief Richard Biehl said at a news conference.
Police did not say Wagoner made up the story and didn't explain why he would have made the report. Biehl did say it appeared Wagoner owed on back taxes. A recording at a phone listing for Wagoner said the voice mail could not accept more messages.
No criminal charges have been filed. Police did extensive testing, including simulating the shots fired into the book.
Scroll down for video. Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority said Wednesday that it has charged Wagoner with violating its employee standards. Biehl said it wasn't credible to believe that bullets didn't pass through the book into Wagoner. Biehl also said that only Wagoner's DNA was found at the scene and that his injuries weren't consistent with defensive wounds.
A blue bandana found at the scene was found to have only dog hairs on it, and a surveillance video that captured the bus recorded the sound of five gunshots when Wagoner claimed that there were only three fired. Wagoner's screams can be heard on the video however on the call the pound bus driver does not appear winded despite claiming he'd run up to feet and fought for his life.

The FBI opened an investigation into the incident as a hate crime and police spokespeople said pious things about how there was probably divine intervention because Wagoner should't even be alive. However, he also got a full-on police investigation out of the deal, which is what happens when you are shot and stabbed, and said police figured out the whole thing was likely self-inflicted.
The only DNA found at the scene was from Wagoner, who police said did not sound out of breath when he drove away on the bus and called a dispatcher to report the shooting. Maybe we'll just pay a friend to shoot us or stab us or run after us or whatever to lend a little more gravitas and truthiness to the whole thing. But if we DO get busted, we hope we get off as easy as Wagoner, who is facing some employee discipline but will not be criminally charged. That is a far sweeter deal than you should really get for ginning up a little racial hate story about gangbanging black teens who only get to be in the club if they shoot a white guy.
On the other hand, we didn't know that "shoot a polar bear" was street slang for white people, so ultimately we feel edified by this whole affair.
