Unable to communicate an address we indicated he take us to Tunis. On the way he stopped to urinate. Then we were off again, weaving erratically between honking vehicles. That vehicle next to us would move over and voila, we had an opening.
After staring at one of our phone maps while driving he seemed to have a revelation. We relaxed immediately savoring the fact he now knew where our hotel was located. But 15 minutes down the road our exit was quickly approaching and he was still four lanes over from the exit. It was not Ok. After we punched him lightly in the arm and pointed dramatically that we needed to exit the road, something clicked and he moved across four lanes of traffic as if he were moving into one lane, leaving cars in our rear view mirror fuming as they accelerated or the drivers fuming as they yelled in anger.
Sometimes you look back at these driving adventures and wonder why we did not get a photo of this driver. For better or for worse probably worse there will be more drivers like this in our travels and the next time we will certainly do so!

Martin Scorsese. More like this. Watch options. Storyline Edit. As he suffers from insomnia, he spends his time working as a taxi driver at night, watching porn movies at seedy cinemas during the day, or thinking about how the world, New York in particular, has deteriorated into a cesspool.
He's a loner who has strong opinions about what is right and wrong with mankind. For him, the one bright spot in New York humanity is Betsy, a worker on the presidential nomination campaign of Senator Charles Palantine. He becomes obsessed with her. After an incident with her, he believes he has to do whatever he needs to make the world a better place in his opinion. One of his priorities is to be the savior for Iris, a twelve-year-old runaway and prostitute who he believes wants out of the profession and under the thumb of her pimp and lover Matthew.
