I want to install the latest chipset drivers, but i want to do it right, so any help is welcome. Someone makes a bullcrap post in one of the forums and gets 22 replies in a day. But when someone has a serious question to ask they get zip, or a reply from a few members that actually try and help when they can.
First off, to Hapatingjaky since you're using XP pro x64 you should probably be using the drivers for it, found here. Otherwise you're going to have to look at the driver info for each individual component in the device manager to compare them to the ones in the driver package. As far as I know there's not a simple way to determine your installed drivers other than the first method.
You should uninstall the entire driver package, all the nvidia drivers besides display before installing new ones, many people have run into problems when they didn't do this. Edit: One day I'll read the date of the original post before I reply to the original poster :D. I have since made my own topic about it since this had over views and only 5 replies at the time, that's 1 reply for every views, quite ridiculous if you ask me. I had a look at the driver information and as far as i can tell it is not up to date, although i can't tell what version i have the date is a few months old so i assume there is an update.
I went to download the nForce drivers, but i am unsure what i should take out exactly, it states that i have to "Uninstall any existing nForce networking drivers prior to installing this package", and i am unsure how to do that exactly.
I want to update the nForce drivers, but i also want to get it right. In Add or Remove programs. Thanks for replying. The new driver package will ask you if you want to install the NAM when you run it. Thanks again for the assistance. The update also installed 'NV Mixer' which seemed fine it's just i had the Realtek 'Soundman' loading up before and now it doesn't. The funny thing is, now i can hear interference through my speakers from my mouse. Every time i move the mouse or use the scroll wheel i can hear the interference, although it is slight it's still audible and quite annoying.
I am almost certain it didn't happen before the nForce driver update, either that or i just couldn't hear it. I thought it was the NV Mixer so i uninstalled it, but it seems that had nothing to do with it, unless it caused it while it was installing, i don't know. Any idea's? Anyway everything seems fine except for the fact i can't overclock the CPU using Asus's AI NOS or presets, Windows does load up and get a blue screen with text on it, i can't get to read it since it flashes on and reboots.
But that's another topic :P Thanks again for the replies and help. I discovered this after returning 5 mb to Asus :blink:. May  Search Everywhere Threads This forum This thread. Search titles only. Search Advanced search…. Everywhere Threads This forum This thread.

Everytime I try to install windows it says I can not install to this drive. ASUS does not list any Windows 7 drivers on its support site for this older board. This is my old pc I decided to put back together just to run movies and music on the projector and entertainment system in the room next to my office.
Any help is greatly apreaciated. I need to put on 3. This is supposedly only needed for an Audigy Platinum. However if that was the cause of all the RAID problems.. Now I've unmounted the audigy2 and everything seems to work. My audigy is not the platinum version but I've a VIVO xxt and it's possible that the problem is related to it. Now I will test the system for a bit to be sure that I've discovered the right problem. A question: if uncheck SBDrvDet with msconfig, audio will work equally?
Thanks a lot, your suggestion was very precious. I had some problems also with Nforce2 and his Silicon controller Thanks for the reply. It's supposed to be something that detects the front panel of the Platinum.
Although I've also seen some people say that it's needed for telling the Creative "live update" feature what version of the driver you have. In any event, my Audigy2 ZS works fine with it turned off. Now I've reinstalled the Audigy2 and searched and found a new driver.
After installing it the problem seems to be resolved. Thanks again. Try to search if there is an update also for you. How can? Ive' installed everything over, and over , and over again in different orders. The error only comes up when i reboot after enabling SLI mode. And then again it does't come up if if i remove all the Creative card drivers and use the mobo sound on the asus SLi delux board.
I hope some one has a fix for the Sound card drivers. I will try to post in the Creative web page for support using this threads Malle'. Just posted for tech support on the creative support page for the driver issue. Ill post the reply hear when i have the definitive answer. But, we live in an age where there are hundreds of progies writing drivers for different hardware, all trying to exist on an X86 platform. This is what Creative Support sent me. With regards to the issue, could you kindly try the following cleansweep uninstall and re-installation of the soundcard?
Uncheck all results and click OK. Click OK and reboot when prompted. Click OK. Otherwise, select WDM. You will then be prompted to reboot, but please do not do so. The Audigy 2 ZS will be detected by Windows. In order to install your soundcard properly, I recommend you to ensure the following for the audio installation and test: - The card is the only card installed other than the Graphics card.
Reboot if prompted. When the file has completed the phase of being transferred to your computer, locate the file on your desktop and double click the file. Does the problem still persists after doing the aboved? Should that not resolve the problem or if you require any further assistance, please let me know. Thank you. I apologize for the inconvenience caused. For faster service please reply with previous correspondence when replying to this email.
If you have a drive bay attachment for the card I.
